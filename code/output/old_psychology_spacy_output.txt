When all his jewels were safely tucked away in his new home, the genie settled in happily.
SVO: ('new  genie', 'settled', 'new  home') TRIPLE:[]
In fact, I'm sure you can still find him sitting in his new, bigger, and better bottle with all his jewels and smiling contentedly even today!
SVO: ('still  him', "'m sure", 'better  jewels') TRIPLE:[]
The computer science department at Gordmont is widely acknowledged to be one of thefinest groups of its kind in the world.
SVO: ('computer science department', 'acknowledged', 'thefinest  world') TRIPLE:[]
Over the last five years, the department has beenranked number one among computer science departments in terms of the number of publicationsby the faculty.
SVO: ('five  department', 'beenranked', 'one computer science faculty') TRIPLE:['department beenranke number']
This success has allowed the members of the faculty to secure anumber of large contracts that provide funds for the professors to carry out their research.
SVO: ('professors', 'allowed', 'research') TRIPLE:['members secure anumber', 'professors carry research']
Unfortunately, the research reputation of this department is only outdone by the personalreputations of the individual faculty.
SVO: ('Unfortunately the research reputation', 'outdone by', 'individual  faculty') TRIPLE:[]
Almost all of the professors are known to be difficultto get along with.
SVO: ('Almost  all', 'known', 'professors') TRIPLE:[]

Red Adair
SVO: ('', 'Adair', '') TRIPLE:[]
An oil well in Saudi Arabia exploded and caught fire.
SVO: ('An oil well', 'exploded', 'in Saudi fire') TRIPLE:[]
The result was a blazing inferno that consumed an enormous quantity of oil each day.
SVO: ('blazing  that', 'was', 'enormous  oil') TRIPLE:[]
After initial efforts to extinguish it failed, famed firefighter Red Adair was called in.
SVO: ('famed firefighter Red Adair', 'called', 'initial  efforts') TRIPLE:[]
Red knew that the fire could be put out if a huge amount of fire retardant foam could be dumped on the base of the well.
SVO: ('huge  amount', 'knew', 'fire retardant well') TRIPLE:[]
There was enough foam available at the site to do the job.
SVO: ('', 'was enough', 'available  job') TRIPLE:[]
However, there was no hose large enough to put all the foam on the fire fast enough.
SVO: ('', 'was', 'enough  fire') TRIPLE:[]
The small hoses that were available could not shoot the foam quickly enough to do any good.
SVO: ('that', 'shoot', 'enough  good') TRIPLE:['hoses shoot foam']
It looked like there would have to be a costly delay before a serious attempt could be made.
SVO: ('serious  attempt', 'looked', '') TRIPLE:[]
However, Red Adair knew just what to do.
SVO: ('However , Red Adair', 'knew', 'just  what') TRIPLE:[]
He stationed men in a circle all around the fire, with all of the available small hoses.
SVO: ('He', 'stationed', 'small  hoses') TRIPLE:['He station men']
When everyone was ready all of the hoses were opened up and foam was directed at the fire from all directions.
SVO: ('foam', 'opened', 'directions') TRIPLE:[]
In this way a huge amount of foam quickly struck the source of the fire.
SVO: ('huge  amount', 'struck', 'quickly  fire') TRIPLE:['amount strike source']
The blaze was extinguished, and the Saudis were satisfied that Red had earned his three million dollar fee.
SVO: ('Red', 'extinguished', 'million million dollar fee') TRIPLE:['Red earn fee']
Fused Light bulb fragile glass UltrasoundIn a physics lab at a major university, a very expensive light bulb which would emit precisely controlled quantities of light was being used in some experiments.
SVO: ('expensive expensive light which', 'bulb fragile', 'controlled  experiments') TRIPLE:['Light bulb glass', 'Light bulb glass lab']
Ruth was the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive light bulb.
SVO: ('sensitive the research light', 'was', 'bulb') TRIPLE:[]
One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the light bulb no longer worked.
SVO: ('light', 'came into', 'dismay') TRIPLE:[]
She realized that she had forgotten to tum it off the previous night.
SVO: ('she', 'realized', 'previous  night') TRIPLE:[]
As a result the light bulb overheated, and two wires in the filament inside the bulb fused together.
SVO: ('two  wires', 'overheated', 'bulb') TRIPLE:[]
The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it.
SVO: ('surrounding surrounding glass bulb', 'sealed', 'completely  it') TRIPLE:[]
Ruth knew that the light bulb could be repaired if a brief, high intensity ultrasound wave could be used to jar apart the fused parts.
SVO: ('high intensity ultrasound wave', 'knew', 'fused  parts') TRIPLE:[]
Furthermore, the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job.
SVO: ('Furthermore  lab', 'had', 'necessary  job') TRIPLE:['lab have equipment']
However, a high intensity ultrasound wave would also break the fragile glass surrounding the filament.
SVO: ('high intensity ultrasound wave', 'break', 'fragile  filament') TRIPLE:['wave break glass']
At lower intensities the ultrasound wave would not break the glass, but neither would it jar apart the fused parts.
SVO: ('it', 'break', 'fused  parts') TRIPLE:['wave break glass', 'it jar parts']
So it seemed that the light bulb could not be repaired, and a costly replacement would be required.
SVO: ('costly  replacement', 'seemed', '') TRIPLE:[]
Ruth was about to give up when she had an idea.
SVO: ('when  she', 'was about', 'idea') TRIPLE:['she have idea']
She placed several ultrasound machines in a circle around the light bulb, and administered low intensity ultrasound waves from several directions all at once.
SVO: ('She', 'placed several', 'several intensity ultrasound directions') TRIPLE:['She place machines']
The waves all converged on the filament, where their combined effect was enough to jar apart the fused parts.
SVO: ('combined  effect', 'converged on', 'fused  parts') TRIPLE:[]
Since each spot on the surrounding glass received only a low intensity wave from one ultrasound machine, the glass was left intact.
SVO: ('one one ultrasound glass', 'left intact', 'one one ultrasound machine') TRIPLE:['spot receive wave']
Ruth was greatly relieved that the light bulb was repaired, and she then went on to successfully complete the experiment.
SVO: ('she', 'relieved', 'successfully  experiment') TRIPLE:[]
The Videogame Sales CaseVortex, Inc., a small video arcade software firm, had a promising new line of special forces videogames.
SVO: ('CaseVortex The Videogame Inc.', 'had', 'special arcade software videogames') TRIPLE:['Inc. have line', 'Inc. have line videogames']
Keppel and Co., a major manufacturer of video arcade equipment in Europe, was working with Vortex to produce the hardware needed for the special forces games.
SVO: ('Keppel', 'working with Vortex', 'special special forces games') TRIPLE:[]
They were negotiating over how to share revenues from their joint product.
SVO: ('They', 'negotiating over', 'joint  product') TRIPLE:[]
The deal was mostly going Vortex wanted to broaden the market for its products and Keppel needed a boost in sales to meet their shareholders expectations for the year.
SVO: ('mostly  Vortex', 'going Vortex', 'their shareholders year') TRIPLE:[]
However, the two companies were struggling with how to split sales revenues.
SVO: ('two  companies', 'struggling with', 'how split sales revenues') TRIPLE:[]
Keppel was demanding a high percentage from sales to finance the added expense of a custom made action control for Vortex games.
SVO: ('Keppel', 'demanding', 'made for Vortex games') TRIPLE:['Keppel demand percentage', 'Keppel demand percentage control']
Further, Keppel knew that it had the greatest resources to get Vortex special forces games on the market.
SVO: ('it', 'knew', 'special special forces market') TRIPLE:['it have resources']
On the other hand, Vortex was also demanding a high percentage from sales on the grounds that what was being sold was their games, they had the patent on the new action control, and Keppel was simply one of several available manufacturers.
SVO: ('new new action Keppel', 'had', 'available  manufacturers') TRIPLE:['Vortex demand percentage', 'they have patent']
Having negotiations at a standstill was bad for both companies because Keppel needed to increase their sales by the end of the year and Vortex needed to get their products out while they were still state of the art.
SVO: ('they', 'was bad', 'still  art') TRIPLE:[]
The breakthrough came when negotiators from Keppel and Vortex began discussing the differing needs of their companies.
SVO: ('when  negotiators', 'came', 'differing  companies') TRIPLE:[]
The negotiation teams reached the following agreement: Vortex would give up some of its share of revenue for the remainder of the year to cover Keppel production costs and to aid their current financial situation.
SVO: ('following  Vortex', 'give', 'financial Keppel production situation') TRIPLE:['teams reach agreement']
In return, Keppel would give up a comparable share of revenue in future fiscal years for these products, and Vortex still maintained their patent on the new control device.
SVO: ('fiscal  Vortex', 'give', 'new new control device') TRIPLE:['Keppel give share', 'Vortex maintain patent']

The GeneralA small country was ruled from a strong fortress by a dictator.
SVO: ('small  country', 'ruled from', 'strong  dictator') TRIPLE:[]
The fortress was situated in the middle of the country, surrounded by farms and villages.
SVO: ('fortress', 'situated in', 'farms') TRIPLE:[]
Many roads led to the fortress through the countryside.
SVO: ('Many  roads', 'led to', 'countryside') TRIPLE:[]
A rebel general vowed to capture the fortress.
SVO: ('rebel  general', 'vowed', 'fortress') TRIPLE:[]
The general knew that an attack by his entire army would capture the fortress.
SVO: ('attack', 'knew', 'entire  fortress') TRIPLE:['attack capture fortress']
He gathered his army at the head of one of the roads, ready to launch a full scale direct attack.
SVO: ('He', 'gathered', 'direct  attack') TRIPLE:['He gather army']
However, the general then learned that the dictator had planted mines on each of the roads.
SVO: ('then  dictator', 'learned', 'roads') TRIPLE:['dictator plant mines']
The mines were set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely, since the dictator needed to move his troops and workers to and from the fortress.
SVO: ('safely  dictator', 'set', 'fortress') TRIPLE:[]
However, any large force would detonate the mines.
SVO: ('large  force', 'detonate', 'mines') TRIPLE:['force detonate mines']
Not only would this blow up the road, but it would also destroy many neighboring villages.
SVO: ('it', 'blow', 'many many neighboring villages') TRIPLE:['it destroy villages']
It therefore seemed impossible to capture the fortress.
SVO: ('It', 'seemed impossible', 'therefore  fortress') TRIPLE:[]
However, the general devised a simple plan.
SVO: ('However  general', 'devised', 'simple  plan') TRIPLE:['general devise plan']
He divided his army into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different road.
SVO: ('He', 'divided', 'different  road') TRIPLE:['He divide army']
When all was ready he gave the signal and each group marched down a different road.
SVO: ('group', 'was ready', 'different  road') TRIPLE:['he give signal']
Each group continued down its road to the fortress so that the entire army arrived together at the fortress at the same time.
SVO: ('entire  army', 'continued down', 'same  time') TRIPLE:[]
In this way, the general captured the fortress and overthrew the dictator.
SVO: ('general', 'captured', 'dictator') TRIPLE:['general capture fortress']
Zerdia Literal Similarity: Once there was an eagle named Zardia who nested on a rocky cliff.

SVO: ('a cross that', 'saw', 'feathers') TRIPLE:[]
The sportsman attacked but the bolts missed.
SVO: ('bolts', 'attacked', '') TRIPLE:[]
Zardia realized that the sportsman wanted her tail feathers so she flew down and donated a few of her tail feathers to the sportsman.
SVO: ('her tail she', 'realized', 'down her tail sportsman') TRIPLE:['sportsman want feathers']
The sportsman was pleased.
SVO: ('sportsman', 'was pleased', '') TRIPLE:[]

The Identical TwinsOnce there were identical twins who were continually playing pranks on their family, friends, and teachers.
SVO: ('identical  who', 'were identical', 'continually  family') TRIPLE:['who play pranks']
The annual school picnic was always a big event for the twins.
SVO: ('annual annual school picnic', 'was', 'big  twins') TRIPLE:[]
There were races and other athletic events in which the twins won lots of prizes.
SVO: ('athletic  twins', 'were', 'prizes') TRIPLE:['twins win lots']
One year a new student arrived who was a star runner.
SVO: ('who', 'arrived', '') TRIPLE:[]
The twins wanted to win the main event: the 2 mile race through the woods behind the school.
SVO: ('twins', 'wanted', '2 2 mile school') TRIPLE:[]
So they secretly devised a plan which would enable them to outdo the newcomer.
SVO: ('secretly  which', 'devised', 'newcomer') TRIPLE:['they devise plan']
The day of the race arrived.
SVO: ('day', 'arrived', 'race') TRIPLE:[]
Each runner was to pick his own path through the woods to a clearing, where a teacher stood posted to determine the winner.
SVO: ('where  teacher', 'was', 'winner') TRIPLE:[]
One twin entered the race, while the other excused himself on the grounds that he had hurt his leg in an earlier broad jumping event.
SVO: ('he', 'entered', 'broad broad jumping event') TRIPLE:['twin enter race', 'he hurt leg']
The race began and the students rushed into the woods.
SVO: ('students', 'began', 'woods') TRIPLE:[]
The twin rushed into the woods and waited until the others had passed out of sight.
SVO: ('others', 'rushed into', 'sight') TRIPLE:[]
Then he went back to the school using a path hidden from the picnic area.
SVO: ('Then  he', 'went', 'back the picnic area') TRIPLE:[]
Shortly after, the other twin, who had been hiding behind a rock near the finish line of the race, burst out and ran into the clearing ahead of the other runners.
SVO: ('who', 'burst', 'other the finish runners') TRIPLE:[]
The teacher named him the winner and marveled at the speed of his running.
SVO: ('teacher', 'named', 'running') TRIPLE:[]
Next year the twins switched places and thereafter maintained their status on this event.
SVO: ('year  twins', 'switched', 'thereafter  event') TRIPLE:['twins switch places']
The Asian Merchant CaseSyd, a recently promoted head buyer of a small retail clothing chain in the United States, had bought some wholesale leather boots from a large Asian manufacturer.
SVO: ('Asian  Merchant', 'bought', 'Asian wholesale leather manufacturer') TRIPLE:['Merchant buy boots']
All aspects of the deal had been successfully negotiated except the shipment of the boots.
SVO: ('aspects', 'negotiated except', 'successfully  boots') TRIPLE:[]
Although Syd thought there might be potential difficulties in dealing with a large multinational conglomerate, she had decided to purchase boots from this rather than from several smaller available because of their aggressive pricing.
SVO: ('multinational  she', 'decided', 'aggressive  pricing') TRIPLE:[]
The sales representative from the Asian company told Syd that they would pay to ship the boots by boat.
SVO: ('Asian  they', 'told Syd', 'boat') TRIPLE:['representative tell Syd']
Syd was concerned because the United States has announced that a trade embargo would likely be placed on all goods from that country in the near future.
SVO: ('a trade embargo', 'concerned', 'near  future') TRIPLE:[]
The Asian sales representative told Syd not to worry because the boat would arrive at the U.S. dock before the embargo occurred.
SVO: ('the U.S. embargo', 'told Syd', 'the U.S. dock') TRIPLE:['representative tell Syd']
Syd, however, thought that the boat would be late and that the multinational conglomerate policy to ship goods was not friendly to the needs of small businesses.
SVO: ('multinational multinational conglomerate policy', 'thought', 'small to ship businesses') TRIPLE:[]
Syd wanted the merchant to pay to ship the boots by air freight (which was substantially more expensive).
SVO: ('by air which', 'wanted', 'by air freight') TRIPLE:[]
The Asian sales representative refused because of the higher cost.
SVO: ('Asian Asian sales representative', 'refused because', 'higher  cost') TRIPLE:[]
They argued about when the boat would arrive.
SVO: ('when  boat', 'argued about', '') TRIPLE:[]
Syd considered breaking off the deal and buying the boots from her next best option, a small manufacturer.
SVO: ('Syd', 'considered', 'best  option') TRIPLE:[]
However, she did not like their product line as well and also wanted to try to establish a relationship with the large multinational conglomerate.
SVO: ('However  she', 'like', 'multinational their product conglomerate') TRIPLE:['she like line']
Finally, after a lengthy discussion in which it seemed that the negotiations might break off unsuccessfully, Syd suggested a new proposal to the sales representative from the Asian manufacturer.
SVO: ('unsuccessfully  Syd', 'suggested', 'Asian the sales manufacturer') TRIPLE:['Syd suggest proposal']
They would send the boots by air freight but both sides would watch when the boat actually docks in the United States.
SVO: ('when  boat', 'send', 'actually the United States') TRIPLE:['They send boots']
If the boat happened to arrive on time (as the sales representative believed it would), Syd would pay for the added cost of air freight.
SVO: ('Syd', 'pay for', 'added of air freight') TRIPLE:[]
However, if the boat were to arrive late (as Syd believed it would), the Asian manufacturer would pay the air freight bill.
SVO: ('Asian  manufacturer', 'pay', 'air freight bill') TRIPLE:['manufacturer pay bill']
Syd and the Asian manufacturer were pleased with this proposal, and each party got the arrangement they wanted.
SVO: ('they', 'were pleased', 'arrangement') TRIPLE:['party get arrangement']

As a result the light bulb overheated, and two wires in the filament inside the bulb fused together.
SVO: ('two  wires', 'overheated', 'bulb') TRIPLE:[]
The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it.
SVO: ('surrounding surrounding glass bulb', 'sealed', 'completely  it') TRIPLE:[]
Ruth knew that the light bulb could be repaired if a brief, high intensity ultrasound wave could be used to jar apart the fused parts.
SVO: ('high intensity ultrasound wave', 'knew', 'fused  parts') TRIPLE:[]
Furthermore, the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job.
SVO: ('Furthermore  lab', 'had', 'necessary  job') TRIPLE:['lab have equipment']
However, the ultrasound machines only generated low intensity waves that were not strong enough to fuse the filament.
SVO: ('low low intensity that', 'generated low', 'enough  filament') TRIPLE:['machines generate waves']
She needed a much more intense ultrasound wave.
SVO: ('She', 'needed', 'intense intense ultrasound wave') TRIPLE:['She need wave']
So it seemed that the light bulb could not be repaired, and a costly replacement would be required.
SVO: ('costly  replacement', 'seemed', '') TRIPLE:[]
Ruth was about to give up when she had an idea.

These small canals are placed around the lake so that they convey water coming from four different valleys.
SVO: ('water', 'placed around', 'different  valleys') TRIPLE:[]
In this way only small amounts of water can flow in each canal and thus during flood periods dangerous overflowings might not occur.
SVO: ('dangerous during flood overflowings', 'flow in', 'thus during flood periods') TRIPLE:[]
At the same time, the lake is fed by water from various valleys, so that also during drought periods it is sufficiently fed.

The Two Poor Brothers CaseTwo fairly poor brothers, Ben and Jerry, had just inherited a working farm whose main crop has a volatile price.
SVO: ('main  crop', 'inherited', 'volatile  price') TRIPLE:['crop have price']
Ben wanted to sell rights to the farm output under a long term contract for a fixed amount rather than depend upon shares of an uncertain revenue stream.

SVO: ('short  Jerry', 'was', '') TRIPLE:[]
The two argued for days and nights.
SVO: ('two', 'argued for', 'days') TRIPLE:[]
Ben wanted to sell immediately because he believed the price of the crop would fall; Jerry wanted to keep the farm because he believed the price of the crop would increase.
SVO: ('price', 'wanted', 'crop') TRIPLE:[]
Jerry could not afford to buy Ben out at the time, but the strain on their family relationship over their disagreements was becoming too large.
SVO: ('strain', 'afford', 'their family disagreements') TRIPLE:[]
Ben had always trusted Jerry instincts in the past, but this time felt Jerry was being overly optimistic.
SVO: ('Jerry', 'trusted Jerry', 'always trusted Jerry past') TRIPLE:['Ben trust instincts']
In an effort to settle the matter and close up the growing rift between them, the two brothers agreed to meet with a family business advisor.

Following the consultation, Jerry proposed a possible agreement to his brother: They would keep the farm for another season.
SVO: ('possible  They', 'keep', 'season') TRIPLE:['Jerry propose agreement', 'They keep farm']
If the price of the crop fell below a certain price (as Ben thought it would), then they would sell the farm and Ben would get 50% of the farm current value, adjusted for inflation; Jerry would get the rest.
SVO: ('current  Jerry', 'get', 'rest') TRIPLE:['they sell farm', 'Ben get %', 'Jerry get rest']
However, if the price of the crop were to rise (as Jerry thought it would), Jerry would buy Ben out for 50% of the farm current value, adjusted for inflation, and would get to keep all of the additional profits for himself.
SVO: ('Jerry', 'buy Ben', 'additional  himself') TRIPLE:['Jerry buy Ben']
Jerry was delighted when his brother told him he could agree to this arrangement, thereby avoiding further conflict.

SVO: ('back the lumber they', 'theorizes', 'wide the lumber person') TRIPLE:[]
Unfortunately, the doctor has found it impossible to test his theory because he is unable to deliver a high velocity thrust of sufficient force because such a thrust requires more strength than the doctor possesses.
SVO: ('more  doctor', 'found', 'more  strength') TRIPLE:['thrust require strength']
The suggestion is: to have the doctor develop a machine that is capable of delivering the high velocity thrust.

Broken Light bulb fragile glass LaserIn a physics lab at a major university, a very expensive light bulb which would emit precisely controlled quantities of light was being used in some experiments.
SVO: ('expensive expensive light which', 'bulb fragile', 'controlled  experiments') TRIPLE:['Light bulb glass', 'Light bulb glass lab']
Ruth was the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive light bulb.
SVO: ('sensitive the research light', 'was', 'bulb') TRIPLE:[]
One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the light bulb no longer worked.
SVO: ('light', 'came into', 'dismay') TRIPLE:[]
She realized that she had forgotten to tum it off the previous night.
SVO: ('she', 'realized', 'previous  night') TRIPLE:[]
As a result the light bulb overheated, and the filament inside the bulb had broken into two parts.
SVO: ('filament', 'overheated', 'two  parts') TRIPLE:[]
The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it.
SVO: ('surrounding surrounding glass bulb', 'sealed', 'completely  it') TRIPLE:[]
Ruth knew that the light bulb could be repaired if a brief, high intensity laser beam could be used to fuse the two parts of the filament into one.
SVO: ('high intensity laser beam', 'knew', 'two  one') TRIPLE:[]
Furthermore, the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job.
SVO: ('Furthermore  lab', 'had', 'necessary  job') TRIPLE:['lab have equipment']
However, a high intensity laser beam would also break the fragile glass surrounding the filament.
SVO: ('high intensity laser beam', 'break', 'fragile  filament') TRIPLE:['beam break glass']
At lower intensities the laser would not break the glass, but neither would it fuse the filament.
SVO: ('it', 'break', 'filament') TRIPLE:['laser break glass', 'it fuse filament']
So it seemed that the light bulb could not be repaired, and a costly replacement would be required.
SVO: ('costly  replacement', 'seemed', '') TRIPLE:[]
Ruth was about to give up when she had an idea.
SVO: ('when  she', 'was about', 'idea') TRIPLE:['she have idea']
She placed several lasers in a circle around the light bulb, and administered low intensity laser beams from several directions all at once.
SVO: ('She', 'placed several', 'several intensity laser directions') TRIPLE:['She place lasers']
The beams all converged on the filament, where their combined effect was enough to fuse it.
SVO: ('combined  effect', 'converged on', 'it') TRIPLE:[]
Since each spot on the surrounding glass received only a low intensity beam from one laser, the glass was left intact.
SVO: ('one low intensity glass', 'left intact', 'one low intensity laser') TRIPLE:['spot receive beam']
Ruth was greatly relieved that the light bulb was repaired, and she then went on to successfully complete the experiment.

SVO: ('troops', 'poised at', 'fortress') TRIPLE:[]
However, a spy brought the general a disturbing report.
SVO: ('However  spy', 'brought', 'disturbing  report') TRIPLE:['spy bring report']
The ruthless dictator had planted mines on each of the roads.
SVO: ('ruthless  dictator', 'planted', 'roads') TRIPLE:['dictator plant mines']
The mines were set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely, since the dictator needed to be able to move troops and workers to and from the fortress.
SVO: ('safely  dictator', 'set', 'fortress') TRIPLE:[]
However, any large force would detonate the mines.
SVO: ('large  force', 'detonate', 'mines') TRIPLE:['force detonate mines']
Not only would this blow up the road and render it impassable, but the dictator would then destroy many villages in retaliation.
SVO: ('dictator', 'blow', 'many  retaliation') TRIPLE:['dictator destroy villages']
A full scale direct attack on the fortress therefore appeared impossible.
SVO: ('direct  attack', 'appeared impossible', 'fortress') TRIPLE:[]
The general, however, was undaunted.
SVO: ('general', 'was undaunted', '') TRIPLE:[]
He divided his army up into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different road.
SVO: ('He', 'divided', 'different  road') TRIPLE:['He divide army']
When all was ready he gave the signal, and each group charged down a different road.
SVO: ('group', 'was ready', 'different  road') TRIPLE:['he give signal', 'group charge road']
All of the small groups passed safely over the mines, and the army then attacked the fortress in full strength.
SVO: ('safely  army', 'passed', 'full  strength') TRIPLE:['army attack fortress']
In this way, the general was able to capture the fortress and overthrow the dictator.

She placed asmall replica of the vessel in the center of a large tank, with a realisticsea bed.
SVO: ('She', 'placed asmall', 'large a realisticsea bed') TRIPLE:['She place replica']
Then she added to the tank sea plants and fish of the sortthat live in the Atlantic at the depth of the sunken Titanic.
SVO: ('Then  she', 'added to', 'sunken tank sea Titanic') TRIPLE:[]
Thedisplay was virtually finished when the designer was confronted witha major problem she had failed to anticipate.
SVO: ('major  she', 'finished', 'major  problem') TRIPLE:[]
In order to maintainthe deep water environment required by the fish and plants, the tankhad to be kept quite dark, as the deep water organisms were notadapted to light.
SVO: ('deep deep water organisms', 'tankhad', 'light') TRIPLE:[]
However, if the tank was kept completely dark,people would not be able to see the small replica of the Titanic in thecenter of the tank, which, after all, was the main point of the exhibit.
SVO: ('small  which', 'be able', 'main  exhibit') TRIPLE:[]
Putting lights inside the model of the wreck looked too artificial.
SVO: ('Putting', 'looked', 'wreck') TRIPLE:[]
Thedesigner considered shining a powerful spotlight on the model of thevessel.
SVO: ('Thedesigner', 'considered', 'powerful  thevessel') TRIPLE:[]
However, if the spotlight was located inside the tank, it wouldraise the temperature of the water too high; and if it was locatedoutside the tank, the bright beam seriously disrupted the feeding habits of some of the fish.
SVO: ('bright  beam', 'wouldraise', 'seriously the feeding fish') TRIPLE:['it wouldraise temperature', 'it locatedoutside tank', 'beam disrupt habits']
So it looked like the display was going tohave an embarrassing shortcoming.
SVO: ('display', 'looked', 'embarrassing  shortcoming') TRIPLE:['display go shortcoming']
What could be done to light the display?

SVO: ('you', 'Remember', 'thestories') TRIPLE:[]
Just before the display was to open, the designer hit upon a newidea.
SVO: ('designer', 'hit upon', 'newidea') TRIPLE:[]
She had several low powered spotlights placed at differentlocations around the outside of the tank, all focused on the replica ofthe ship.
SVO: ('powered  all', 'had several', 'replica ofthe ship') TRIPLE:['She have spotlights']
Each of the lights was quite dim, so the light averse fish werenot disturbed as they swam around the Titanic.
SVO: ('werenot  they', 'was', 'Titanic') TRIPLE:[]
But since all of thelights were focused on the ship, their beams added up so as toilluminate it enough that its realistic details could be seen by viewers.
SVO: ('realistic  details', 'added', 'viewers') TRIPLE:[]
When the display opened, everyone thought it was both realistic andesthetically striking.
SVO: ('it', 'thought', '') TRIPLE:[]
An engineer plans the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy.
SVO: ('engineer', 'plans', 'electric  energy') TRIPLE:['engineer plan construction']
According to his first plan, a unique wide canal collects water coming from a valley and convey it into the lake.
SVO: ('water', 'collects', 'lake') TRIPLE:[]
The total labor cost for the construction of such canal is $17,664.
SVO: ('total total labor cost', 'is', 'such  canal') TRIPLE:[]
However, the engineer realizes that the capacity of the lake is not sufficient to produce the needed amount of energy.
SVO: ('capacity', 'realizes', 'needed  energy') TRIPLE:[]
However, it is`not possible to enlarge the lake because there are no free areas around it.
SVO: ('However  it', 'is`not possible', 'free  it') TRIPLE:[]
In order to avoid this mishap, the engineer elaborates a second plan.
SVO: ('engineer', 'elaborates', 'second  plan') TRIPLE:['engineer elaborate plan']
According to this plan, the lake must be deepened so that it contains a higher amount of water.
SVO: ('it', 'deepened', 'higher  water') TRIPLE:['it contain amount']
To implement the second plan 12 laborers have to work 8 hours daily for 23 days.
SVO: ('12  laborers', 'implement', '23  days') TRIPLE:[]
Each laborer is paid $8 for each hour of work.
SVO: ('laborer', 'paid', '$  work') TRIPLE:[]
The total labor of the second plan is cheaper, equal or more expansive than the labor of the first plan?
SVO: ('total  labor', 'is cheaper', 'first  plan') TRIPLE:[]

Karla the Hawk: Karla, an old hawk, lived at the top of a tall oak tree.
SVO: ('Karla', 'lived at', 'tall tall oak tree') TRIPLE:[]
One afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers.
SVO: ('crude  that', 'saw', 'feathers') TRIPLE:['she see hunter']
The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but missed.
SVO: ('hunter', 'took', 'hawk') TRIPLE:['hunter take aim']
Karla knew the hunter wanted her feathers
SVO: ('hunter', 'knew', 'feathers') TRIPLE:['hunter want feathers']
so she glided down to the hunter and offered to give him a few.
SVO: ('so  she', 'glided', 'few') TRIPLE:[]
The hunter was so grateful that he pledged never to shoot at a hawk again.
SVO: ('so  he', 'was', 'hawk') TRIPLE:[]
He went off and shot a deer instead.

An engineer had to plan the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy.
SVO: ('engineer', 'had', 'electric  energy') TRIPLE:[]
To feed the lake he thought to build a unique wide canal collecting water coming from a near valley.
SVO: ('he', 'feed', 'near  valley') TRIPLE:[]
However, a mason pointed out that during the flood periods the stream of water flowing along the canal might be too strong and might damage the surrounding areas; by contrast, during the drought periods a unique stream of water might be insufficient to feed the lake.
SVO: ('unique the drought stream', 'pointed', 'lake') TRIPLE:[]
In order to avoid these mishaps, the mason suggested to build, instead of a unique wide canal, four small canals whose total flow was the same as the unique wide canal previously planned.
SVO: ('total  flow', 'suggested', 'wide  canal') TRIPLE:[]
These small canals were placed around the lake so that they conveyed water coming from four different valleys.
SVO: ('they', 'placed around', 'different  valleys') TRIPLE:['they convey water']
In this way only small amounts of water could flow in each canal and thus during flood periods dangerous overflowing might not occur.
SVO: ('dangerous during flood overflowing', 'flow in', 'thus during flood periods') TRIPLE:[]
At the same time, the lake was fed by water from various belts, so that also during drought periods it was sufficiency that the fed.
SVO: ('also during drought it', 'fed by', 'also during drought periods') TRIPLE:[]
The Fire ChiefOne night a fire broke out in a wood shed full of timber on Mr Johnson place.
SVO: ('fire', 'broke', 'full Mr Johnson place') TRIPLE:[]
As soon as he saw flames he sounded the alarm, and within minutes dozens of neighbors were on the scene armed with buckets.
SVO: ('dozens', 'sounded', 'buckets') TRIPLE:['he see flames', 'he sound alarm']
The shed was already burning fiercely, and everyone was afraid that if it t controlled quickly the house would go up next.
SVO: ('quickly  house', 'burning', '') TRIPLE:[]
Fortunately, the shed was right beside a lake, so there was plenty of water available.
SVO: ('Fortunately  shed', 'was', 'so  water') TRIPLE:[]
If a large volume of water could hit the fire at the same time, it would be extinguished.
SVO: ('same  it', 'extinguished', 'same  time') TRIPLE:['volume hit fire']
But with only small buckets to work with, it was hard to make any headway.
SVO: ('small  it', 'was hard', 'headway') TRIPLE:[]
The fire seemed to evaporate each bucket of water before it hit the wood.
SVO: ('it', 'seemed', 'wood') TRIPLE:['it hit wood']
It looked like the house was doomed.
SVO: ('house', 'looked', '') TRIPLE:[]
Just then the fire chief arrived.
SVO: ('then the fire chief', 'arrived', '') TRIPLE:[]
He immediately took charge and organized everyone.
SVO: ('He', 'took', 'immediately  everyone') TRIPLE:['He take charge']
He had everyone fill their bucket and then wait in a circle surrounding the burning shed.
SVO: ('everyone', 'had', 'then the burning shed') TRIPLE:['everyone fill bucket']
As soon as the last man was prepared, the chief gave a shout and everyone threw their bucket of water at the tire.
SVO: ('everyone', 'gave', 'tire') TRIPLE:['chief give shout', 'everyone throw bucket']
The force of all the water together dampened the fire right down, and it was quickly brought under control, Mr Johnson was relieved that his house was saved, and the village council voted the tire chief a raise in pay.
SVO: ('the village council', 'relieved', 'raise the tire pay') TRIPLE:['force dampen fire', 'council vote chief']
The music department at Gordmont is a relatively new department, begun in 1987 inresponse to student pressure for more music classes.
SVO: ('The music department', 'is', 'more more music classes') TRIPLE:[]
Because of the focus on undergraduateeducation at Gordmont, the University searched for the best instructors that it couldfind.
SVO: ('best  it', 'searched for', 'best  that') TRIPLE:[]
The success of this effort is evident in the fact that the faculty in this department havebeen awarded the prestigious University Teaching Award in each of the last three years.
SVO: ('faculty', 'is evident', 'three University Teaching years') TRIPLE:['faculty award Award']
Interestingly, the music department is also the smallest on campus.
SVO: ('Interestingly the music department', 'is', 'also  campus') TRIPLE:[]
Because it is a newdepartment, it has taken some time to hire as many faculty as were originally planned whenthe department was formed.
SVO: ('whenthe  department', 'taken', 'many  faculty') TRIPLE:['it take time']
Miss Piggy most precious possessions were her jewels.
SVO: ('Miss Piggy', 'were', '') TRIPLE:[]
She kept them in a jewel box on top of her dresser.
SVO: ('She', 'kept', 'a jewel dresser') TRIPLE:[]
She decided they weren't very safe there, so she wanted to move them to a strong safe on the other side of the room.
SVO: ('so  she', 'wanted', 'other  room') TRIPLE:[]
Miss Piggy started to carry a few of her jewels across the room to the safe.
SVO: ('Miss Piggy', 'started', 'safe') TRIPLE:[]
But just then Gonzo went running through the room, with Fozzy Bear chasing him.
SVO: ('with Fozzy Bear', 'running through', 'him') TRIPLE:[]
They almost knocked Miss Piggy down.
SVO: ('They', 'knocked Miss', 'almost knocked Miss Piggy') TRIPLE:['They knock Piggy']
She was afraid they would come back at any moment and make her drop some jewels and lose them.
SVO: ('back  her', 'was afraid', 'them') TRIPLE:['her drop jewels']
She had so many jewels how could she get them all over to the safe quickly and safely?
SVO: ('how  she', 'had', 'over  safe') TRIPLE:['She have jewels']
Suddenly Miss Piggy had a great idea.
SVO: ('Suddenly Suddenly Miss Piggy', 'had', 'great  idea') TRIPLE:['Piggy have idea']
She rolled up her carpet off the floor and picked it up.
SVO: ('She', 'rolled', 'it') TRIPLE:['She roll carpet']
The carpet just reached from her jewel box to the safe.
SVO: ('carpet', 'reached from', 'just her jewel safe') TRIPLE:[]
Then Miss Piggy quickly rolled her jewels through the rolled carpet and into the safe.
SVO: ('Then Then Miss Piggy', 'rolled', 'rolled  safe') TRIPLE:['Piggy roll jewels']
She was finished in a jiffy, before Fozzy Bear and Gonzo came back.
SVO: ('before Fozzy Bear', 'finished in', 'jiffy') TRIPLE:[]

SVO: ('general', 'wanted', 'army') TRIPLE:[]
The general wanted to prevent mines on the roads from destroying his army and neighboring villages.
SVO: ('general', 'wanted', 'army') TRIPLE:[]
As a result the entire army could not attack the fortress along one road.
SVO: ('entire  army', 'attack', 'one  road') TRIPLE:['army attack fortress']
However, the entire army was needed to capture the fortress.
SVO: ('entire  army', 'needed', 'fortress') TRIPLE:[]
So an attack by one small group would not succeed.
SVO: ('So  attack', 'succeed', 'small  group') TRIPLE:[]
The general therefore divided his army into several small groups.
SVO: ('general', 'divided', 'small  groups') TRIPLE:['general divide army']
He positioned the small groups at the heads of different roads.
SVO: ('He', 'positioned', 'different  roads') TRIPLE:['He position groups']
The small groups simultaneously converged on the fortress.
SVO: ('small  groups', 'converged on', 'simultaneously  fortress') TRIPLE:[]
In this way the army captured the fortress.
SVO: ('army', 'captured', 'fortress') TRIPLE:['army capture fortress']
