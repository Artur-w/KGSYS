Jerry, on the other hand, was confident that the next season would be spectacular and revenues would be high. In short, Jerry was risk seeking. The two argued for days and nights. Ben wanted to sell immediately because he believed the price of the crop would fall; Jerry wanted to keep the farm because he believed the price of the crop would increase. Jerry could not afford to buy Ben out at the time, but the strain on their family relationship over their disagreements was becoming too large. Ben had always trusted Jerry�s instincts in the past, but this time felt Jerry was being overly optimistic. In an effort to settle the matter and close up the growing rift between them, the two brothers agreed to meet with a family business advisor. Following the consultation, Jerry proposed a possible agreement to his brother: They would keep the farm for another season. If the price of the crop fell below a certain price (as Ben thought it would), then they would sell the farm and Ben would get 50% of the farm�s current value, adjusted for inflation; Jerry would get the rest. However, if the price of the crop were to rise (as Jerry thought it would), Jerry would buy Ben out for 50% of the farm�s current value, adjusted for inflation, and would get to keep all of the additional profits for himself.
