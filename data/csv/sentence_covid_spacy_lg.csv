"The lung scans were the first sign of trouble."
"In the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, clinical radiologist Ali Gholamrezanezhad began to notice that some people who had cleared their COVID-19 infection still had distinct signs of damage."
"“Unfortunately, sometimes the scar never goes away,” he says."
""
""
"Gholamrezanezhad, at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and his team started tracking patients in January using computed tomography (CT) scanning to study their lungs."
"They followed up on 33 of them more than a month later, and their as-yet-unpublished data suggest that more than one-third had tissue death that has led to visible scars."
"The team plans to follow the group for several years."
""
""
""
"These patients are likely to represent the worst-case scenario."
"Because most infected people do not end up in hospital, Gholamrezanezhad says the overall rate of such intermediate-term lung damage is likely to be much lower — his best guess is that it is less than 10%."
"Nevertheless, given that 28.2 million people are known to have been infected so far, and that the lungs are just one of the places that clinicians have detected damage, even that low percentage implies that hundreds of thousands of people are experiencing lasting health consequences."
""
""
""
"Doctors are now concerned that the pandemic will lead to a significant surge of people battling lasting illnesses and disabilities."
"Because the disease is so new, no one knows yet what the long-term impacts will be."
"Some of the damage is likely to be a side effect of intensive treatments such as intubation, whereas other lingering problems could be caused by the virus itself."
"But preliminary studies and existing research into other coronaviruses suggest that the virus can injure multiple organs and cause some surprising symptoms."
""
""
"People with more severe infections might experience long-term damage not just in their lungs, but in their heart, immune system, brain and elsewhere."
"Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, suggests that these effects can last for years."
""
""
""
"And although in some cases the most severe infections also cause the worst long-term impacts, even mild cases can have life-changing effects — notably a lingering malaise similar to chronic fatigue syndrome."
""
""
""
"Many researchers are now launching follow-up studies of people who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19."
"Several of these focus on damage to specific organs or systems; others plan to track a range of effects."
"In the United Kingdom, the [Post-Hospitalisation COVID-19 Study](https://www.phosp.org/) (PHOSP-COVID) aims to follow 10,000 patients for a year, analysing clinical factors such as blood tests and scans, and collecting data on biomarkers."
"A similar study of hundreds of people over 2 years launched in the United States at the end of July."
""
""
""
"What they find will be crucial in treating those with lasting symptoms and trying to prevent new infections from lingering."
"“We need clinical guidelines on what this care of survivors of COVID-19 should look like,” says Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious-diseases clinician at Boston University School of Medicine in Massachusetts, who is setting up a clinic to support people with COVID-19."
"“That can’t evolve until we quantify the problem.”"

"## Enduring effects"
""
""
"In the first few months of the pandemic, as governments scrambled to stem the spread by implementing lockdowns and hospitals struggled to cope with the tide of cases, most research focused on treating or preventing infection."
""
""
""
"Doctors were well aware that viral infections could lead to chronic illness, but exploring that was not a priority."
"“At the beginning, everything was acute, and now we’re recognizing that there may be more problems,” says Helen Su, an immunologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland."
"“There is a definite need for long-term studies.”"
""
""
""
"The obvious place to check for long-term harm is in the lungs, because COVID-19 begins as a respiratory infection."
"Few peer-reviewed studies exploring lasting lung damage have been published."
"Gholamrezanezhad’s team analysed lung CT images of 919 patients from published studies [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR1), and found that the lower lobes of the lungs are the most frequently damaged."
"The scans were riddled with opaque patches that indicate inflammation, that might make it difficult to breathe during sustained exercise."
"Visible damage normally reduced after two weeks [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR1)."
"An Austrian study also found that lung damage lessened with time: 88% of participants had visible damage 6 weeks after being discharged from hospital, but by 12 weeks, this number had fallen to 56% (see [go.nature.com/3hiiopi](https://go.nature.com/3hiiopi) )."
""
""
""
"Su and her colleagues hope to enrol thousands of people worldwide in a project called the COVID Human Genetic Effort, which aims to find genetic variants that compromise people’s immune systems and make them more vulnerable to the virus."
"They plan to expand the study to those with long-term impairment, hoping to understand why their symptoms persist and to find ways to help them."
"“Someone who has prolonged problems, beyond what would be normally seen, they would be of interest to study,” says Su."
""
""
""
"The virus can also have the opposite effect, causing parts of the immune system to become overactive and trigger harmful inflammation throughout the body."
"This is well documented in the acute phase of the illness, and is implicated in some of the short-term impacts."
"For instance, it might explain why a small number of children with COVID-19 develop widespread inflammation and organ problems."
""
""
""
"This immune over-reaction can also happen in adults with severe COVID-19, and researchers want to know more about the knock-on effects after the virus has run its course."
"“It seems there’s a lag there for it to get hold of the person and then cause this severe inflammation,” says Adrienne Randolph, a senior associate in critical-care medicine at Boston Children’s Hospital."
"“But then the thing is that, long term, when they recover, how long does it take the immune system to settle back to normality?”"
""
""
""
"## Heart of the matter"
""
""
"An over-reactive immune system can lead to inflammation, and one particularly susceptible organ is the heart."
"During the acute phase of COVID-19, about one-third of patients show cardiovascular symptoms, says Mao Chen, a cardiologist at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China."
"“It’s absolutely one of the short-term consequences.”"
""
""
""
"One such symptom is cardiomyopathy, in which the muscles of the heart become stretched, stiff or thickened, affecting the heart’s ability to pump blood."
"Some patients also have pulmonary thrombosis, in which a clot [blocks a blood vessel in the lungs](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01403-8)."
"The virus can also injure the wider circulatory system, for instance, by infecting the cells lining blood vessels [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR5)."
""
""
""
"Similar long-term studies are needed to understand the neurological and psychological consequences of COVID-19."
"Many people who become severely ill experience neurological complications such as delirium, and there is evidence that cognitive difficulties, including confusion and memory loss, [persist for some time after the acute symptoms have cleared](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02599-5)."
"But it is not clear whether this is because the virus can infect the brain, or whether the symptoms are a secondary consequence — perhaps of inflammation."
""
""
""
"## Chronic fatigue"
""
""
"One of the most insidious long-term effects of COVID-19 is its least understood: severe fatigue."
"Over the past nine months, an increasing number of people have reported crippling exhaustion and malaise after having the virus."
"Support groups on sites such as Facebook host thousands of members, who sometimes call themselves “long-haulers”."
"They struggle to get out of bed, or to work for more than a few minutes or hours at a time."
"One study [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR7) of 143 people with COVID-19 discharged from a hospital in Rome found that 53% had reported fatigue and 43% had shortness of breath an average of 2 months after their symptoms started."
"A study of patients in China showed that 25% had abnormal lung function after 3 months, and that 16% were still fatigued [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR8)."
""
""
"Paul Garner, a infectious-disease researcher at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK, has experienced this at first hand."
"His initial symptoms were mild, but he has since experienced “a roller coaster of ill health, extreme emotions and utter exhaustion”."
"His mind became “foggy” and new symptoms cropped up almost every day, ranging from breathlessness to arthritis in his hands."
""
""
""
"These symptoms resemble chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)."
"The medical profession has struggled for decades to define the disease — leading to a [breakdown of trust with some patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-08965-0)."
"There are no known biomarkers, so it can only be diagnosed based on symptoms."
"Because the cause is not fully understood, it is unclear how to develop a treatment."
"Dismissive attitudes from doctors persist, according to some patients."
""
""
""
"People reporting chronic fatigue after having COVID-19 describe similar difficulties."
"In the forums, many long-haulers say they have received little or no support from doctors — perhaps because many of them showed only mild symptoms, or none at all, and were never hospitalized or in danger of dying."
"It will not be easy to establish the links between COVID-19 and fatigue with certainty, says Randolph."
"Fatigue does not seem to be limited to severe cases."
"It is common in people who had mild symptoms and who therefore might not have been tested for the virus."
""
""
""
"The only way to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 is behind these symptoms is to compare people known to have had the virus with those who have not, says Chertow, to see how often fatigue manifests and in what form."
"Otherwise there is a risk of lumping together people whose fatigue has manifested for different reasons, and who might need distinct treatments."
""
""
""
"Chertow says he is not aware of such a study for COVID-19, but they have been done for other diseases."
"Following the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014–16, US researchers collaborated with the Ministry of Health in Liberia to perform a long-term follow-up study [9](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR9) called Prevail III."
"The study identified six long-term impacts from Ebola, ranging from joint pain to memory loss."
"Bhadelia, who treated hundreds of people with Ebola during the outbreak, says that these post-viral symptoms had not previously been recognized."
"Usually, she says, “we don’t stick around past the acute stage."
"We don’t look at the long tail of recovery."
"It’s important to do that, because it tells you more about the virus and its pathophysiology.”"
""
""
""
"The situation is clearer for people who have been severely ill with COVID-19, especially those who ended up on ventilators, says Chertow."
"In the worst cases, patients experience injury to muscles or the nerves that supply them, and often face “a really long-fought battle on the order of months or up to years” to regain their previous health and fitness, he says."
"He and his colleagues are now recruiting people with COVID-19 from across the severity spectrum for a long-term follow-up study, assessing their brains, lungs, hearts, kidneys and inflammation responses while they are acutely ill, then during recovery a few weeks later, and again after 6–12 months (see [go.nature.com/3mfqqxc](https://go.nature.com/3mfqqxc) )."
""
""
"Once again, there is evidence from SARS that coronavirus infection can cause long-term fatigue."
"In 2011, Harvey Moldofsky and John Patcai at the University of Toronto in Canada described 22 people with SARS, all of whom remained unable to work 13–36 months after infection [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR10)."
"Compared with matched controls, they had persistent fatigue, muscle pain, depression and disrupted sleep."
"Another study [11](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR11), published in 2009, tracked people with SARS for 4 years and found that 40% had chronic fatigue."
"Many were unemployed and had experienced social stigmatization."
""
""
""
"It is not clear how viruses might do this damage, but a 2017 review [12](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR12) of the literature on chronic fatigue syndrome found that many patients have persistent low-level inflammation, possibly triggered by infection."
""
""
""
"If COVID-19 is such a trigger, a wave of psychological effects “may be imminent”, write a group of researchers led by Declan Lyons, a psychiatrist at St Patrick’s Mental Health Services in Dublin [13](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR13)."
"The ME Association, a UK-based charity, says it has received many reports of previously healthy people whose energy levels have not returned to normal after becoming infected with the virus, and expects to see new cases of chronic fatigue syndrome."
"In many countries, the pandemic shows no sign of waning, and health systems are already at capacity responding to acute cases."
"Nevertheless, researchers say it is crucial to start digging into the long-term effects now."
""
""
""
"But the answers will not come quickly."
"“The problem is,” says Gholamrezanezhad, “to assess long-term consequences, the only thing you need is time.”"
"Covid‐19 can involve multiple organs including the nervous system."
"We sought to characterize the neurologic manifestations, their risk factors, and associated outcomes in hospitalized patients with Covid‐19."
""
""
""
"We examined neurologic manifestations in 509 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed Covid‐19 within a hospital network in Chicago, Illinois."
"We compared the severity of Covid‐19 and outcomes in patients with and without neurologic manifestations."
"We also identified independent predictors of any neurologic manifestations, encephalopathy, and functional outcome using binary logistic regression."
""
""
""
"Neurologic manifestations were present at Covid‐19 onset in 215 (42.2%), at hospitalization in 319 (62.7%), and at any time during the disease course in 419 patients (82.3%)."
"The most frequent neurologic manifestations were myalgias (44.8%), headaches (37.7%), encephalopathy (31.8%), dizziness (29.7%), dysgeusia (15.9%), and anosmia (11.4%)."
"Strokes, movement disorders, motor and sensory deficits, ataxia, and seizures were uncommon (0.2 to 1.4% of patients each)."
"Severe respiratory disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 134 patients (26.3%)."
"Independent risk factors for developing any neurologic manifestation were severe Covid‐19 (OR 4.02; 95% CI 2.04–8.89; *P*  < 0.001) and younger age (OR 0.982; 95% CI 0.968–0.996; *P*  = 0.014)."
"Of all patients, 362 (71.1%) had a favorable functional outcome at discharge (modified Rankin Scale 0–2)."
"However, encephalopathy was independently associated with worse functional outcome (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.11–0.42; *P*  < 0.001) and higher mortality within 30 days of hospitalization (35 [21.7%] vs. 11 [3.2%] patients; *P*  < 0.001)."
""
""
""
"Neurologic manifestations occur in most hospitalized Covid‐19 patients."
"Encephalopathy was associated with increased morbidity and mortality, independent of respiratory disease severity."
""
""
""
"As of 8 September 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has led to over 26.5 million confirmed infections and 875,000 deaths from coronavirus disease‐2019 (Covid‐19)"

"Like most infections caused by members of the coronavirus family, SARS‐CoV‐2 manifests itself with upper respiratory tract infections and flu‐like symptoms of varying severity.[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0002)"
"However, Covid‐19 is unique in its ability to cause a multi‐organ disease, with involvement of the central and peripheral nervous system in some individuals."
""
""
""
"Indeed, a wide range of neurologic manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection have been recognized, and evidence of their severity and persistence is increasing.[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0003) - [10](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0010)"
"However, the frequency of those manifestations and associated risk factors remain unclear."
"We sought to characterize the incidence of neurologic manifestations, in patients with confirmed Covid‐19 and identify factors associated with the development of neurologic manifestations in hospitalized patients with both severe and non‐severe respiratory disease."
"Furthermore, neurologic manifestations, especially encephalopathy, have been associated with worse clinical outcomes in other systemic illnesses including sepsis and may even lead to significant disability.[11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0011), [12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0012)"
"Therefore, we sought to identify if encephalopathy was associated with greater morbidity in hospitalized patients with Covid‐19."
""
""

"We retrospectively analyzed the first consecutive patients admitted with Covid‐19 to the Northwestern Medicine Healthcare (NMHC) system between 5 March and 6 April 2020."
"NMHC consists of one academic medical center (AMC) and nine other hospitals in the Chicago area."
"Covid‐19 diagnosis was confirmed by SARS‐CoV‐2 reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swab or broncho‐alveolar lavage fluid."
"All laboratory and radiologic assessments were performed as part of routine clinical care."
"This study was approved by our institutional review board (STU00212627) with waiver of consent for retrospective analysis."
""
""
""
"Demographic, medical comorbidity, pre‐hospitalization medication usage, and hospital course data were collected by electronic medical record review."
"Laboratory data were collected by automated electronic query."
"Neurologic manifestations were identified by review of clinical notes, diagnostic studies, and physician‐documented diagnoses."
"The identification of neurologic manifestations, the dates of neurologic manifestation onset, and Covid‐19 symptom onset dates was facilitated by electronic note templates implemented in the NMHC System as part of the Covid‐19 response."
"In particular, encephalopathy was identified by (a) report of altered mental status or depressed level of consciousness, (b) physician documented diagnosis of encephalopathy or the delirium encephalopathy syndrome, or (c) positive Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) evaluation."
"The Confusion Assessment Method is a well‐validated and widely used clinical and research tool for the identification of the delirium encephalopathy syndrome and has been in routine clinical use at NMHC since 2008.[13](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0013) -"

"Neurologic manifestations were included starting on the date of Covid‐19 onset, as identified by the patient’s clinical provider, through 90 days."
"In cases where neurologic manifestations were not specifically attributed to a documented diagnosis, the cases were independently adjudicated by two separate neurologists (AB and EML)."
"A third neurologist independently reviewed the chart to serve as a tie‐breaker (IJK) in cases of disagreement."
"In those cases where neurologic manifestations were attributed to a specific neurologic diagnosis (e.g., stroke), the patient was recorded as having that specific diagnosis rather than each component neurologic manifestation."
"Patients were dichotomized into severe versus non‐severe Covid‐19 respiratory disease based on the need for mechanical ventilation during hospitalization; this criterion was used to account for the possibility of delayed clinical deterioration after hospital admission."
""
""
""
"Functional outcome at hospital discharge was extracted from therapy and rehabilitation medicine physician documentation using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) categorized as: mRS 0–2, able to look after ones’ own affairs without assistance; mRS 3, ambulates unassisted but needs help with ones’ own affairs; mRS 4–5, unable to ambulate unassisted and needs assistance for bodily care; and mRS 6, death."
"The discharge mRS scores were determined independently by two reviewers and disagreements were reconciled by majority decision after review (EML)."
""
""

"Data were summarized as number of patients (frequency), mean (standard deviation) for normally distributed variables, and median (interquartile range [IQR]) for non‐normally distributed variables."
"Associations were assessed using Fisher’s exact test, Spearman’s rank correlation test, and Wilcoxon rank‐sum test."
"Binary logistic regression models were developed to identify adjusted predictors of: (1) experiencing any neurologic manifestations, (2) experiencing encephalopathy, and (3) having a favorable discharge functional outcome (mRS 0–2)."
"In each case, we first developed a model using *a priori* variables based on biologic plausibility and review of the recent Covid‐19 literature."
"Then we developed models using the *a priori* variables plus additional variables univariately associated with the model outcome at *P*  ≤ 0.15 and not highly collinear with a variable already included."
"To avoid overfitting models to the data, we used a backward variable selection algorithm based on Akaike Information Criteria optimization to develop final *parsimoniously adjusted* models."
"Details of the *a priori* and *parsimonious* models, including the *a priori* variables for each model, are included in the Table [S2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#support-information-section)."
"We also developed an *a priori* binary logistic regression model for the association between encephalopathy and 30‐day mortality adjusted for age, severe Covid‐19 disease, and hospitalization at the AMC; limited numbers of patient deaths prevented inclusion of additional variables for adjustment."

"There were 509 consecutive patients included in the study (age 58.5 ± 16.9 years, 281 (55.2%) males), and 134 (26.3%) had severe Covid‐19 requiring mechanical ventilation."
"Neurologic manifestations were present at Covid‐19 onset in 215 patients (42.2%), at hospital admission in 319 patients (62.7%) and at any time during the disease course in 419 patients (82.3%)."

"Differences in frequencies may be caused by genetic factors including polymorphism in expression of the viral receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) in the nervous system, and possibly, SARS‐CoV‐2 strain variations.[18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0018)"
"In addition, our hospital network system was never stressed beyond capacity due to surge preparation and most patients had moderate disease, with only one quarter developing severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation.[19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0019)"
"This may have allowed for more detailed evaluation and identification of neurologic manifestations."
""
""
""
"The fact that any neurologic manifestations as a whole were more likely to occur in younger people is surprising, and could potentially be explained by greater clinical emphasis on the risk of respiratory failure than other symptoms in older patients."
"Alternatively, early neurologic manifestations such as myalgia, headache, or dizziness may have prompted earlier medical care."
"In contrast, encephalopathy was more frequent in older patients."
"Risk factors for encephalopathy also included severe Covid‐19 disease and history of any neurological disorder or chronic kidney disease."
"This is consistent with recent literature identifying higher rates of mortality in Covid‐19 patients with pre‐existing chronic neurological disorders.[20](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0020)"
""
""
"The increased morbidity and mortality associated with encephalopathy, independent of respiratory severity, parallels previous literature in sepsis‐associated encephalopathy and delirium‐associated mortality [11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0011), [21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0021) and emphasizes its relevance in Covid‐19."
"We also found that encephalopathy in Covid‐19 was associated with triple the hospital length of stay."
"Broad recognition and screening for encephalopathy as a contributor to disease severity in Covid‐19 may have utility in resource allocation and potential to improve patient outcomes."
"Furthermore, our findings emphasize the broader need to develop interventions that target encephalopathy as a component of multi‐organ system medical illness."
""
""
""
"The cause of encephalopathy could not be determined with certainty given the lack of extensive diagnostic neurologic testing for most patients in this study due to ongoing pandemic restrictions."
"However, the most likely etiology of encephalopathy in patients with Covid‐19 is multifactorial, including systemic disease and inflammation, coagulopathy, direct neuroinvasion by the virus, endotheliitis and possibly post‐infectious auto‐immune"
"mechanisms.[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0005)"
"Additionally, traditional risk factors associated with intensive care unit delirium and encephalopathy also need to be taken into account, including sedation and analgesia doses, disruption of sleep/wake cycles, and infectious complications.[22](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0022), [23](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0023)"

""
""
"Our hospital network system includes an AMC and nine other hospitals."
"There was no meaningful difference in severity of disease between the AMC and the other hospitals, but patients at the AMC had better functional outcomes and lower 30‐day mortality."
"One potential explanation for this finding may be related to specialty care, access to resources, and lower rates of do not resuscitate/intubate and comfort measures‐only orders."
"Our AMC is also the largest hospital within the NMHC system with the greatest number of ICU beds, which may confer a survival benefit to critically ill patients with Covid‐19.[25](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0025)"

"Early adoption and implementation of uniform treatment protocols across hospital networks driven by AMCs may be a means to improve outcome and lower mortality of Covid‐19 patients that deserves further investigations."
""
""
""
"Our study has limitations, including its retrospective nature, and the fact that fewer than 6% of patients were evaluated by neurologists or neurosurgeons."
"Since most patients were admitted to dedicated Covid‐19 wards or ICUs with strict infection control precautions in place, access to brain CT or MRI was not as readily available as for other patients with neurologic diseases."
"This limited a more complete neurologic work up in many Covid‐19 patients."
"Additionally, patients were cared for at 10 different hospitals and there may have been varying rates of local geographic infection severity."
"However, this provided us with a more generalized view of the neurologic manifestations in Covid‐19 patients and could identify opportunities for regionalized resource allocation and preparedness protocols in a large hospital network system."
""
""
""
"Only 9 months into the pandemic, the long‐term effects of Covid‐19 on the nervous system remain uncertain."
"Our results suggest that, of all neurologic manifestations, encephalopathy is associated with a worse functional outcome in hospitalized patients with Covid‐19, and may have lasting effects.[12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0012)"
"Long‐term follow‐up is necessary to assess the true burden of encephalopathy in these patients."
"Whether milder forms occur in non‐hospitalized individuals with Covid‐19 who complain of protracted inability to concentrate or decreased short term memory (referred to as ‘brain fog’) warrants further evaluation.[27](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0027)"

"More than one million people around the world have been deemed recovered from the coronavirus, but"
"beating the initial sickness may be just the first of many battles for those who have survived."
""
""
""
"Some recovered patients report breathlessness, fatigue and body pain months after first becoming infected."
"Small-scale studies conducted in Hong Kong and Wuhan, China show that survivors grapple with poorer functioning in their lungs, heart and liver."
"And that may be the tip of the iceberg."
""
""
""
"The coronavirus is now known to attack many parts of the body beyond the respiratory system, causing damage from the eyeballs to the toes, the gut to the kidneys."
"Patients’ immune systems can go into overdrive to fight off the infection, compounding the damage done."
""
""
""
"While researchers are only starting to track the long-term health of survivors, past epidemics caused by similar viruses show that the aftermath can last more than a decade."
"According to one study, survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, suffered lung infections, higher cholesterol levels and were falling sick more frequently than others for as long as 12 years after the epidemic coursed through Asia, killing almost 800 people."
""
""
""
"SARS infected 8,000 people."
"With more than 4 million -- and more every day -- infected by the coronavirus, the long-term damage to health could strain social safety nets and health-care infrastructures for years to come as well as have implications for economies and companies."
""
""
""
"The prospect led Nicholas Hart, the British physician who treated Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to call the virus “this generation’s polio” -- a disease that could leave many marked by its scars and reshape global health care."
""
""
"“What these chronic issues ultimately look like – and how many patients ultimately experience them – will have huge implications for patients, the doctors who treat them, and the health systems around them,” said Kimberly Powers, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who is developing models on the virus’s spread to inform public-health efforts."

"### Early Research"
""
""
"Hong Kong’s hospital authority has been monitoring a group of Covid-19 patients for up to two months since they were released."
"They found about half of the 20 survivors had lung function below the normal range, said Owen Tsang, the medical director of the infectious disease center at Princess Margaret Hospital."
""
""
""
"The diffusing capacity of their lungs -- how well oxygen and carbon dioxide transfers between the lungs and blood -- remained below healthy levels, Tsang observed."
""
""
""
"A study of blood samples from 25 recovered patients in Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged, found that they had not fully recovered normal functioning regardless of the severity of their coronavirus symptoms, [according to a paper published April 7](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053819v2)."

"In another study, CT scans taken over a month of 90 Wuhan coronavirus patients found that of the 70 discharged from the hospital, 66 had mild to substantial residual lung abnormalities on their last CT scans, which showed ground-glass opacity, said a March paper published online [in Radiology](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020200843)."
""
""
""
"Chronic cardiac complications could arise in patients even after recovery as a result of persistent inflammation, according to an [April 3 paper](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.317055) by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles."
"They based their analysis on patient data from Italy and China."
""
""
""
"### SARS Evidence"
""
""
"For clues on how Covid-19 may leave its mark, doctors and researchers are looking to the experience of SARS."
"Some survivors suffered long-term effects years after they first succumbed to the disease, which is part of the same family as the new coronavirus."
""
""
""
"Researchers in China analyzed 25 SARS patients 12 years after they contracted the virus, contrasting their results with a control group who were not infected with SARS."
"The study found that more than half of the recovered patients suffered another lung infection since their bout with SARS and also had higher cholesterol levels."
"Additionally, half the patients had at least five colds in the previous year — a characteristic no one in the control group shared, said the 2017 paper published online in [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09536-z)."

"“These data demonstrated that the recovered SARS patients had a poor quality of life 12 years following recovery, and were susceptible to inflammation, tumors, and glucose and lipid metabolic disorders,” researchers wrote."
""
""
""
"Doctors like Tsang at Hong Kong’s Princess Margaret Hospital said looking at former SARS patients is potentially instructive."
"Among survivors of the SARS outbreak of 2003, [chronic fatigue](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/415378) and [impaired lung function](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2010.01720.x) have been found in follow-up studies after two to four years."
""
""
"“This is so new that I don’t think anyone is able to tell what is the percentage of patients who will recover, what is the percentage of patients who will not recover and have long-term sequela,” said Michelle Biehl, a critical care pulmonary doctor at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, using the medical term for chronic conditions after a disease."
""
""
""
"### Societal Implications"
""
""
"Tracking and figuring out how Covid-19 affects the body even after recovery could inform governments budgeting for social safety nets, doctors that see patients long term, and businesses as they set policies such as sick and disability leave."
"These issues could be even more crucial as public health officials say there’s a possibility the virus may become a seasonal affliction."
""
""
""
"Economies and companies looking to get people back to work will need to understand how and if Covid-19 affects human health in the long run and its scope."
""
""
"“There is such a wide range in the way the illness affects people."
"The various stakeholders need solid data to help them understand the breadth and duration of long term effects,” said Jessica Justman, a professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia University."
""
""
"There is some hope: Early intervention could play a role in longer-term outcomes of coronavirus patients, said Ivan Hung, a professor of medicine at the University of Hong Kong."
"Hung said in April that 90% of about 200 discharged patients he oversaw at a clinic at one of the city’s hospitals appear to be making a full recovery a month out."
""
""
""
"He attributed the success to Hong Kong’s “early diagnosis and early treatment” of patients, which leaves the virus with less time to wreak havoc on the body."
""
""
""
"This may not be possible in many countries like the U.S. and U.K where testing is uneven and inadequate, and only those with serious symptoms are getting treatment."
""
""
""
"Still, larger-scale studies in virus hot spots are needed to separate the physical legacy of the virus from how patients feel immediately after fighting off the infection."
"It will be crucial for scientists to track and quantify how Covid-19 affects such factors as oxygenation and breathing rate, said Roberto Bruzzone, a visiting professor at the University of Hong Kong, whose research focuses on cell biology."
""
""
""
"Hospitals and researchers will have begun patient registries to start gathering data to study survivors over time as well."
""
""
""
"“We need an epidemiological study that may be feasible in places like Wuhan, New York City, Milan or Paris -- where there has been a huge group of infections with a wide variety of symptoms,” Bruzzone said."

"Hong Kong’s top pandemic doctor sees a way out of intensive care for thousands of Covid-19 patients: keeping them from entering in the first place."
""
""
""
"After sobering experiences 17 years ago with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Yuen Kwok-Yung is advocating early, aggressive hospitalization and treatment to minimize ravaging disease and death."
"Hong Kong’s [2%](https://chp-dashboard.geodata.gov.hk/covid-19/en.html) Covid-19 fatality rate as of Friday, well below the [global average](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality), lends weight to the approach."
""
""
""
"Most therapies for SARS-CoV-2 are authorized for use in severely ill patients, in some cases backed by research that’s still in question."
"Yuen, the Henry Fok professor in infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong for 15 years, is admitting patients with minimal disease so they can be isolated, monitored and treated if needed."
""
""
""
"“In places like the U.K. and U.S., usually if you have mild symptoms, you are not admitted to a hospital at all -- you just wait at home until you feel very bad or you have shortness of breath,” he explained over Zoom from his office."
"“But we basically admit any patients, even without much symptoms, into the hospital for isolation.”"
""
""
""
"The strategy reduces transmission in the community, and enables patients to enter a clinical trial and receive experimental treatment soon after developing a fever or showing other signs of worsening illness, Yuen said."
"That’s critical because the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus or “viral load” in patients peaks at around the time symptoms appear -- similar to influenza."
""
""
""
"### Microbiologist, Surgeon, Physician"
""
""
"Yuen, who [graduated](https://scholars.croucher.org.hk/scholars/yuen-kwok-yung) from the University of Hong Kong in 1981 and has the rare distinction of being a microbiologist, surgeon and physician, has been at the forefront of the city’s response to infectious outbreaks for decades."
"In 1998, he and colleagues [described](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673698011829) the first dozen patients afflicted with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza."
"Five years later, they [reported SARS](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2803%2913077-2) in a patient visiting Hong Kong from Guangzhou, China."

"Soon after, he identified “ [a time bomb](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2176051/pdf/0023-07.pdf) ” of environmental and social conditions that he predicted would inevitably result in more deadly coronavirus outbreaks."
""

"If the body mounts a good [interferon response](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/tiom-ioa100920.php) when the viral load is low, it can limit subsequent viral replication and prevent dangerous inflammation, Yuen said."
"A late or delayed interferon response to a high viral load, though, may trigger severe damage to the lungs."
"“This is really disastrous,” he said."
"That’s made injections of interferon the “backbone” of early treatments."
""
""
""
"Some doctors outside Hong Kong agree with Yuen’s approach."
"Using antivirals early may suppress viral load and prevent the serious hyper-inflammatory response some patients develop in their second week of illness, said Richard Russell, a respiratory physician and senior clinical researcher in the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford, who is also conducting studies on Covid-19 patients."
""
""
""
"Yuen’s strategy has pointed to how multiple existing antivirals may be [repurposed](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/tag/clofazimine/) and partnered with immune-modulating drugs as a bridge until protective vaccines become available, said Steven Opal, clinical professor of medicine at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island."

"# Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Findings in Competitive Athletes Recovering From COVID-19 Infection"
""
"Myocarditis is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes and can occur with normal ventricular function.1 Recent studies have raised concerns of myocardial inflammation after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), even in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients.2"
"Our objective was to investigate the use of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in competitive athletes recovered from COVID-19 to detect myocardial inflammation that would identify high-risk athletes for return to competitive play."
""
"# Methods"
""
"We performed a comprehensive CMR examination including cine, T1 and T2 mapping, extracellular volume fraction, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), on a 1.5-T scanner (Magnetom Sola; Siemens Healthineers) using standardized protocols,3 in all competitive athletes referred to the sports medicine clinic after testing positive for COVID-19 (reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction) between June and August 2020."
"The Ohio State University institutional review board approved the study, and informed consent in writing was obtained from participating athletes."
"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed after recommended quarantine (11-53 days)."
"Electrocardiogram, serum troponin I, and transthoracic echocardiogram were performed on day of CMR imaging."
""
"# Results"
""
"We performed CMR imaging in 26 competitive college athletes (mean [SD] age, 19.5 [1.5] years; 15 male [57.7%]) from the following sports: football, soccer, lacrosse, basketball, and track."

"Of 26 competitive athletes, 4 (15%) had CMR findings suggestive of myocarditis and 8 additional athletes (30.8%) exhibited LGE without T2 elevation suggestive of prior myocardial injury."
"COVID-19–related myocardial injury in competitive athletes and sports participation remains unclear."
"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to identify a high-risk cohort for adverse outcomes and may, importantly, risk stratify athletes for safe participation because CMR mapping techniques have a high negative predictive value to rule out myocarditis.4 A recent study by Puntmann et al2 demonstrated cardiac involvement in a significant number of patients who had recovered from COVID-19."
"A recent expert consensus article recommended 2-week convalescence followed by no diagnostic cardiac testing if asymptomatic and an electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiogram in mildly symptomatic athletes with COVID-19 to return to play for competitive sports.5 However, emerging knowledge and CMR observations question this recommendation."
"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging evidence of myocardial inflammation has been associated with poor outcomes, including myocardial dysfunction and mortality.6 Study limitations include lack of baseline CMR imaging and variable timing of CMR imaging from a positive COVID-19 test result."
"Athletic cardiac adaptation could be responsible for these abnormalities; however, in this cohort, mean (SD) T2 in those with suspected myocarditis was 59 (3) milliseconds vs 51 (2) milliseconds in those without, favoring pathology."
"Additionally, the rate of LGE (42%) is higher than in previously described normative populations."
"To conclude, while long-term follow-up and large studies including control populations are required to understand CMR changes in competitive athletes, CMR may provide an excellent risk-stratification assessment for myocarditis in athletes who have recovered from COVID-19 to guide safe competitive sports participation."

"Myocarditis is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes and can occur with normal ventricular function.1 Recent studies have raised concerns of myocardial inflammation after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), even in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients.2"
"Our objective was to investigate the use of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in competitive athletes recovered from COVID-19 to detect myocardial inflammation that would identify high-risk athletes for return to competitive play."
""
""
""
"# Methods"
""
"We performed a comprehensive CMR examination including cine, T1 and T2 mapping, extracellular volume fraction, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), on a 1.5-T scanner (Magnetom Sola; Siemens Healthineers) using standardized protocols,3 in all competitive athletes referred to the sports medicine clinic after testing positive for COVID-19 (reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction) between June and August 2020."
"The Ohio State University institutional review board approved the study, and informed consent in writing was obtained from participating athletes."
"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed after recommended quarantine (11-53 days)."
"Electrocardiogram, serum troponin I, and transthoracic echocardiogram were performed on day of CMR imaging."
""
"# Results"
""
"We performed CMR imaging in 26 competitive college athletes (mean [SD] age, 19.5 [1.5] years; 15 male [57.7%]) from the following sports: football, soccer, lacrosse, basketball, and track."
"No athletes required hospitalization or received COVID-19–specific antiviral therapy."
"Twelve athletes (26.9%; including 7 female individuals) reported mild symptoms during the short-term infection (sore throat, shortness of breath, myalgias, fever), while others were asymptomatic."
"There were no diagnostic ST/T wave changes on electrocardiogram, and ventricular volumes and function were within the normal range in all athletes by transthoracic echocardiogram and CMR imaging."
"No athlete had elevated serum levels of troponin I. Four athletes (15%; all male individuals) had CMR findings consistent with myocarditis based on the presence of 2 main features of the updated Lake Louise Criteria: myocardial edema by elevated T2 signal and myocardial injury by presence of nonischemic LGE (~Figure~).4"
"Pericardial effusion was present in 2 athletes with CMR evidence of myocarditis."
"Two of these 4 athletes with evidence of myocardial inflammation had mild symptoms (shortness of breath), while the other 2 were asymptomatic."
"Twelve athletes (46%) had LGE (mean of 2 American Heart Association segments), of whom 8 (30.8%) had LGE without concomitant T2 elevation (~Table~)."

"### Early Research"
""
""
"Hong Kong’s hospital authority has been monitoring a group of Covid-19 patients for up to two months since they were released."
"They found about half of the 20 survivors had lung function below the normal range, said Owen Tsang, the medical director of the infectious disease center at Princess Margaret Hospital."
""
""
""
"The diffusing capacity of their lungs -- how well oxygen and carbon dioxide transfers between the lungs and blood -- remained below healthy levels, Tsang observed."
""
""
""
"A study of blood samples from 25 recovered patients in Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged, found that they had not fully recovered normal functioning regardless of the severity of their coronavirus symptoms, [according to a paper published April 7](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053819v2)."

"They based their analysis on patient data from Italy and China."

""
""
"### SARS Evidence"
""
""
"For clues on how Covid-19 may leave its mark, doctors and researchers are looking to the experience of SARS."
"Some survivors suffered long-term effects years after they first succumbed to the disease, which is part of the same family as the new coronavirus."
""
""
""
"Researchers in China analyzed 25 SARS patients 12 years after they contracted the virus, contrasting their results with a control group who were not infected with SARS."
"The study found that more than half of the recovered patients suffered another lung infection since their bout with SARS and also had higher cholesterol levels."
"Additionally, half the patients had at least five colds in the previous year — a characteristic no one in the control group shared, said the 2017 paper published online in [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09536-z)."

""
""
""
"Doctors like Tsang at Hong Kong’s Princess Margaret Hospital said looking at former SARS patients is potentially instructive."
"Among survivors of the SARS outbreak of 2003, [chronic fatigue](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/415378) and [impaired lung function](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2010.01720.x) have been found in follow-up studies after two to four years."

""
""
""
"### Societal Implications"
""
""
"Tracking and figuring out how Covid-19 affects the body even after recovery could inform governments budgeting for social safety nets, doctors that see patients long term, and businesses as they set policies such as sick and disability leave."
"These issues could be even more crucial as public health officials say there’s a possibility the virus may become a seasonal affliction."
""
""
""
"Economies and companies looking to get people back to work will need to understand how and if Covid-19 affects human health in the long run and its scope."
""
""
"“There is such a wide range in the way the illness affects people."
"The various stakeholders need solid data to help them understand the breadth and duration of long term effects,” said Jessica Justman, a professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia University."
""
""
"There is some hope: Early intervention could play a role in longer-term outcomes of coronavirus patients, said Ivan Hung, a professor of medicine at the University of Hong Kong."
"Hung said in April that 90% of about 200 discharged patients he oversaw at a clinic at one of the city’s hospitals appear to be making a full recovery a month out."
""
""
""
"He attributed the success to Hong Kong’s “early diagnosis and early treatment” of patients, which leaves the virus with less time to wreak havoc on the body."
""
""
""
"This may not be possible in many countries like the U.S. and U.K where testing is uneven and inadequate, and only those with serious symptoms are getting treatment."
""
""
""
"Still, larger-scale studies in virus hot spots are needed to separate the physical legacy of the virus from how patients feel immediately after fighting off the infection."
"It will be crucial for scientists to track and quantify how Covid-19 affects such factors as oxygenation and breathing rate, said Roberto Bruzzone, a visiting professor at the University of Hong Kong, whose research focuses on cell biology."
""
""
""
"Hospitals and researchers will have begun patient registries to start gathering data to study survivors over time as well."
""

"“We need an epidemiological study that may be feasible in places like Wuhan, New York City, Milan or Paris -- where there has been a huge group of infections with a wide variety of symptoms,” Bruzzone said."

""
"Hong Kong’s top pandemic doctor sees a way out of intensive care for thousands of Covid-19 patients: keeping them from entering in the first place."
""
""
""
"After sobering experiences 17 years ago with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Yuen Kwok-Yung is advocating early, aggressive hospitalization and treatment to minimize ravaging disease and death."
"Hong Kong’s [2%](https://chp-dashboard.geodata.gov.hk/covid-19/en.html) Covid-19 fatality rate as of Friday, well below the [global average](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality), lends weight to the approach."
""
""
""
"Most therapies for SARS-CoV-2 are authorized for use in severely ill patients, in some cases backed by research that’s still in question."
"Yuen, the Henry Fok professor in infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong for 15 years, is admitting patients with minimal disease so they can be isolated, monitored and treated if needed."
""
""
""
"“In places like the U.K. and U.S., usually if you have mild symptoms, you are not admitted to a hospital at all -- you just wait at home until you feel very bad or you have shortness of breath,” he explained over Zoom from his office."
"“But we basically admit any patients, even without much symptoms, into the hospital for isolation.”"
""
""
""
"The strategy reduces transmission in the community, and enables patients to enter a clinical trial and receive experimental treatment soon after developing a fever or showing other signs of worsening illness, Yuen said."
"That’s critical because the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus or “viral load” in patients peaks at around the time symptoms appear -- similar to influenza."
""
""
""
"### Microbiologist, Surgeon, Physician"
""
"Yuen, who [graduated](https://scholars.croucher.org.hk/scholars/yuen-kwok-yung) from the University of Hong Kong in 1981 and has the rare distinction of being a microbiologist, surgeon and physician, has been at the forefront of the city’s response to infectious outbreaks for decades."
"In 1998, he and colleagues [described](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673698011829) the first dozen patients afflicted with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza."
"Five years later, they [reported SARS](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2803%2913077-2) in a patient visiting Hong Kong from Guangzhou, China."
""
""
""
"Yuen recalls the trial and error involved in saving patients from SARS, also caused by a coronavirus."
"Soon after, he identified “ [a time bomb](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2176051/pdf/0023-07.pdf) ” of environmental and social conditions that he predicted would inevitably result in more deadly coronavirus outbreaks."
""
""
""
"That prediction came true in December, when the first cases of a [mysterious pneumonia](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-03/pneumonia-outbreak-spurs-fever-checks-from-singapore-to-taiwan) came to light in Wuhan, in China’s Hubei province."
"Hong Kong responded to the novel coronavirus by preparing tests and advising citizens to wear masks."
""
""
""
"Meantime, Yuen’s lab was conducting research that led to the [first reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-29/10-year-old-boy-raises-fears-wuhan-virus-could-spread-undetected) cluster among family members in which human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus occurred."
"In February, he joined the WHO-China Joint Mission to investigate the country’s early response and his lab has since reported a number of important findings, including the first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 [reinfection](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-24/hong-kong-reports-first-coronavirus-re-infection-in-it-worker)."
""
""
""
"### Bitter Lesson"
""
"“All this is an extension of our experience in the year 2003,” Yuen said."
"“We have nothing to brag about because we learned bitterly from 2003 SARS.”"
""
""
"The appearance of an unknown virus to which no one has immunity created a desperate need for effective treatments."
"Hong Kong doctors are using several experimental treatments, including infusions of [convalescent plasma](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-87123/v1/6b671699-488a-4a06-98bf-e538b06fc81c.pdf) -- a mix of factors extracted from recovered patients’ blood -- and injections of interferon, an immune-system protein."
""
""
""
"They’re also using the antivirals ribavirin and Kaletra, although [preliminary results](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20209817v1.full.pdf) released Thursday from a [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news/item/15-10-2020-solidarity-therapeutics-trial-produces-conclusive-evidence-on-the-effectiveness-of-repurposed-drugs-for-covid-19-in-record-time)"
"-led trial involving 11,266 patients in 30 countries found they don’t decrease patients deaths."
"Yuen said he wasn’t surprised by the results of the WHO’s study because the drugs weren’t administered soon after patients became ill."
""
""
"“No antiviral will work if given late,” he said."
"The drugs were also administered singly, rather in combinations that could add to their impact, he said."
""
""
""
"### ‘Modestly Active’"
"“We know that one drug is not good because all of these are very modestly active,” Yuen said."
"“We need early cocktail therapy to get good results.”"
""
""
"Giving a combination of ribavirin, Kaletra and interferon to patients in the first week of illness reduced the time to clear the virus by six days and shortened hospitalization by a week, when compared with giving Kaletra alone, Yuen and colleagues showed in a [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2931042-4/fulltext) in May."
""
""
""
"The trial, published in The Lancet medical journal, recruited 127 patients from Feb. 10 to March 20 -- more than half of the Covid-19 cases reported in Hong Kong during that period."
"Patients began treatment about five days after developing symptoms."
""
""
"“With the memory of the 2003 SARS pandemic, most patients with Covid-19 in Hong Kong accepted antiviral treatment, which explained our high recruitment rate,” Yuen and his team wrote."
""
""
""
"Sixteen years earlier, Yuen and many from the same group [showed](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/thoraxjnl/59/3/252.full.pdf) that a cocktail of ribavirin and Kaletra prevented serious illness and death in SARS patients."
"Saudi Arabia researchers said earlier this month that Kaletra given with interferon [improved survival](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2015294?articleTools=true) in patients hospitalized with Middle East respiratory syndrome, also caused by a coronavirus."
"The effect was greatest when treatment was started within a week of symptom onset, the authors said, noting “an important time-to-treatment effect on mortality.”"
""
""
""
"### Interferon Response"
"Evidence is mounting for early use of interferon in some patients."
"Blockbuster studies published by the journal Science last month showed about 14% of critical Covid-19 patients have insufficient levels of the substance, which orchestrates defenses against viral pathogens."
""

""
"[Read More: Covid Doctors Find a Turning Point in Life-Threatening Cases](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-24/covid-doctors-follow-dna-trail-to-potential-immune-treatment)"
""
""
"If the body mounts a good [interferon response](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/tiom-ioa100920.php) when the viral load is low, it can limit subsequent viral replication and prevent dangerous inflammation, Yuen said."
"A late or delayed interferon response to a high viral load, though, may trigger severe damage to the lungs."
"“This is really disastrous,” he said."
"That’s made injections of interferon the “backbone” of early treatments."
""
""
""
"Some doctors outside Hong Kong agree with Yuen’s approach."
"Using antivirals early may suppress viral load and prevent the serious hyper-inflammatory response some patients develop in their second week of illness, said Richard Russell, a respiratory physician and senior clinical researcher in the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford, who is also conducting studies on Covid-19 patients."
""
""
""
"Yuen’s strategy has pointed to how multiple existing antivirals may be [repurposed](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/tag/clofazimine/) and partnered with immune-modulating drugs as a bridge until protective vaccines become available, said Steven Opal, clinical professor of medicine at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island."
""
""
""
"Dexamethasone, a cheap, generic anti-inflammatory, was [found in June](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2021436) to reduce deaths by almost a third among Covid-19 patients receiving mechanical ventilation."
"The University of Oxford study confirmed what Yuen had observed with SARS patients in 2003: that the medication could quell the immune overreaction, sometimes called a cytokine storm, in deteriorating patients showing signs of inflammation."
""

"[remdesivir](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764) help patients with more advanced disease, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."
"“The one thing we really need to do is get a bunch more interventions for early infection to prevent people from going on to needing hospitalization,” he said in an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L2neaUZhnQ) with the American Lung Association this month."
""

"Antibodies that are specifically designed to fight the coronavirus may also help, Fauci said."

""
"Yuen’s team is also investigating the potential of [clofazimine](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04465695), an inexpensive, 50-year-old antimicrobial that’s on the WHO’s list of essential medicines for leprosy."
"[Studies in hamsters](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-86169/v1/57c06246-52a5-4a3f-b340-d7cfd8583960.pdf) indicated it could fight SARS-CoV-2 and prevent infection."
""
""
""
"Hong Kong took rapid and decisive action in response to Covid-19 because of the legacy of SARS, Yuen said."
"He hopes others will learn from the current crisis about the need to prepare for and mitigate the risks of future pandemics."
""
""
"“It’s the 2003 experience that allowed us to walk another mile early,” Yuen said."
"“I hope that everybody in the world will learn this time that emerging infectious disease is something that would happen more and more frequently.”"

"# Half of COVID-19 patients receiving echocardiograms show heart abnormalities"
""
"**Around half of COVID-19 patients who received an echocardiogram in-hospital showed abnormalities in heart function, according to a prospective international survey funded by the British Heart Foundation and published in the European Heart Journal‒Cardiovascular Imaging."
"The study, authored by Marc Dweck (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK), found that around one in seven showed severe abnormalities likely to have a major effect on their survival and recovery."
"**"
""
""
"It also showed that one in three patients who received an echocardiography scan had their treatment changed as a result."
"The findings suggest that heart scans could prove crucial for identifying patients who may benefit from additional treatments to improve their COVID-19 recovery and prevent potential long-term damage to their heart, the Foundation said in a press release."
""
""
""
"Marc Dweck, the study’s lead author and British Heart Foundation senior lecturer and consultant cardiologist at the University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, UK), said: “COVID-19 is a complex, multisystem disease which can have profound effects on many parts of the body, including the heart."
"Many doctors have been hesitant to order echocardiograms for patients with COVID-19 because it’s an added procedure which involves close contact with patients."
"Our work shows that these scans are important – they improved the treatment for a third of patients who received them.”"
""
""
""
"Researchers from the British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence at the University of Edinburgh looked at echocardiogram results of 1,216 patients from 69 countries with COVID-19.The scan results were sourced from many Covid-19 hotspots around the world, allowing researchers to urgently understand the impact of Covid-19 on the heart while the pandemic was at its peak."
""
""
""
"In the study, over half (55%) of patients, including those with pre-existing heart disease, showed abnormal changes to the way their heart was pumping, with around one in seven showing evidence of severe dysfunction."
"The majority (901) had no known heart disease before the study and showed similar changes."
"Almost half (46%) and one in eight (13%) showed abnormal changes and severe dysfunction respectively."
"These changes were observed for the first time during the patients’ COVID-19 illness and the researchers believe they could be due to the effects of the virus."
""
""
""
"Results showed that left ventricular abnormalities were reported in 479 (39%) patients, with echocardiographic evidence of new myocardial infarction in 36 (3%), myocarditis in 35 (3%), and takotsubo cardiomyopathy in 19 (2%)."
"Left ventricular impairment was classified as mild, moderate, or severe in 17, 12, and 9% of patients, respectively."
"Right ventricular abnormalities were reported in 397 (33%) patients, with mild or moderate right ventricular impairment in 19% and severe impairment in 6%."
""
""
""
"Right ventricular dilatation (15%), elevated pulmonary artery pressures (8%), and a D-shaped left ventricle (4%) were reported less frequently."
"Cardiac tamponade and endocarditis were reported in 11 (1%) and 14 (1%) patients, respectively."
"Severe cardiac disease, defined as severe left or right ventricular dysfunction or cardiac tamponade, was reported in 1 in 7 patients (n = 182, 15%)."
""
""
""
"In the study, one third of patients had their treatment changed as a result of the echocardiogram."
"This included being given medicines for heart failure, or more careful control of fluids and therapy designed to support heart function."
""
""
""
"The researchers point out several limitations to the study given its observational design."
"During the pandemic the number of scans being carried out would have been balanced with the risk of exposing staff, patients and equipment to the virus, they note, and patients who received the scans were in hospital and had suspected heart complications, usually because they had abnormal blood markers reflecting heart damage."
"This study does not tell us how common heart changes are in people who did not receive a scan."
""
""
""
"# The lasting misery of coronavirus long-haulers"
""
"The lung scans were the first sign of trouble."
"In the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, clinical radiologist Ali Gholamrezanezhad began to notice that some people who had cleared their COVID-19 infection still had distinct signs of damage."
"“Unfortunately, sometimes the scar never goes away,” he says."
""
""
"Gholamrezanezhad, at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and his team started tracking patients in January using computed tomography (CT) scanning to study their lungs."
"They followed up on 33 of them more than a month later, and their as-yet-unpublished data suggest that more than one-third had tissue death that has led to visible scars."
"The team plans to follow the group for several years."
""
""
""
"These patients are likely to represent the worst-case scenario."
"Because most infected people do not end up in hospital, Gholamrezanezhad says the overall rate of such intermediate-term lung damage is likely to be much lower — his best guess is that it is less than 10%."
"Nevertheless, given that 28.2 million people are known to have been infected so far, and that the lungs are just one of the places that clinicians have detected damage, even that low percentage implies that hundreds of thousands of people are experiencing lasting health consequences."
""
""
""
"Doctors are now concerned that the pandemic will lead to a significant surge of people battling lasting illnesses and disabilities."
"Because the disease is so new, no one knows yet what the long-term impacts will be."
"Some of the damage is likely to be a side effect of intensive treatments such as intubation, whereas other lingering problems could be caused by the virus itself."
"But preliminary studies and existing research into other coronaviruses suggest that the virus can injure multiple organs and cause some surprising symptoms."
""
""
"People with more severe infections might experience long-term damage not just in their lungs, but in their heart, immune system, brain and elsewhere."
"Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, suggests that these effects can last for years."
""
""
""
"And although in some cases the most severe infections also cause the worst long-term impacts, even mild cases can have life-changing effects — notably a lingering malaise similar to chronic fatigue syndrome."
""
""
""
"Many researchers are now launching follow-up studies of people who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19."
"Several of these focus on damage to specific organs or systems; others plan to track a range of effects."
"In the United Kingdom, the [Post-Hospitalisation COVID-19 Study](https://www.phosp.org/) (PHOSP-COVID) aims to follow 10,000 patients for a year, analysing clinical factors such as blood tests and scans, and collecting data on biomarkers."
"A similar study of hundreds of people over 2 years launched in the United States at the end of July."
""
""
""
"What they find will be crucial in treating those with lasting symptoms and trying to prevent new infections from lingering."
"“We need clinical guidelines on what this care of survivors of COVID-19 should look like,” says Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious-diseases clinician at Boston University School of Medicine in Massachusetts, who is setting up a clinic to support people with COVID-19."
"“That can’t evolve until we quantify the problem.”"
""
""
""
"## Enduring effects"
""
"In the first few months of the pandemic, as governments scrambled to stem the spread by implementing lockdowns and hospitals struggled to cope with the tide of cases, most research focused on treating or preventing infection."
""
""
""
"Doctors were well aware that viral infections could lead to chronic illness, but exploring that was not a priority."
"“At the beginning, everything was acute, and now we’re recognizing that there may be more problems,” says Helen Su, an immunologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland."
"“There is a definite need for long-term studies.”"
""
""
""
"The obvious place to check for long-term harm is in the lungs, because COVID-19 begins as a respiratory infection."
"Few peer-reviewed studies exploring lasting lung damage have been published."
"Gholamrezanezhad’s team analysed lung CT images of 919 patients from published studies [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR1), and found that the lower lobes of the lungs are the most frequently damaged."
"The scans were riddled with opaque patches that indicate inflammation, that might make it difficult to breathe during sustained exercise."
"Visible damage normally reduced after two weeks [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR1)."
"An Austrian study also found that lung damage lessened with time: 88% of participants had visible damage 6 weeks after being discharged from hospital, but by 12 weeks, this number had fallen to 56% (see [go.nature.com/3hiiopi](https://go.nature.com/3hiiopi) )."
""
""
""
"Su and her colleagues hope to enrol thousands of people worldwide in a project called the COVID Human Genetic Effort, which aims to find genetic variants that compromise people’s immune systems and make them more vulnerable to the virus."
"They plan to expand the study to those with long-term impairment, hoping to understand why their symptoms persist and to find ways to help them."
"“Someone who has prolonged problems, beyond what would be normally seen, they would be of interest to study,” says Su."
""
""
""
"The virus can also have the opposite effect, causing parts of the immune system to become overactive and trigger harmful inflammation throughout the body."
"This is well documented in the acute phase of the illness, and is implicated in some of the short-term impacts."
"For instance, it might explain why a small number of children with COVID-19 develop widespread inflammation and organ problems."
""
""
""
"This immune over-reaction can also happen in adults with severe COVID-19, and researchers want to know more about the knock-on effects after the virus has run its course."
"“It seems there’s a lag there for it to get hold of the person and then cause this severe inflammation,” says Adrienne Randolph, a senior associate in critical-care medicine at Boston Children’s Hospital."
"“But then the thing is that, long term, when they recover, how long does it take the immune system to settle back to normality?”"
""
""
""
"## Heart of the matter"
""
"An over-reactive immune system can lead to inflammation, and one particularly susceptible organ is the heart."
"During the acute phase of COVID-19, about one-third of patients show cardiovascular symptoms, says Mao Chen, a cardiologist at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China."
"“It’s absolutely one of the short-term consequences.”"
""
""
""
"One such symptom is cardiomyopathy, in which the muscles of the heart become stretched, stiff or thickened, affecting the heart’s ability to pump blood."
"Some patients also have pulmonary thrombosis, in which a clot [blocks a blood vessel in the lungs](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01403-8)."
"The virus can also injure the wider circulatory system, for instance, by infecting the cells lining blood vessels [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR5)."
""
""
""
"Similar long-term studies are needed to understand the neurological and psychological consequences of COVID-19."
"Many people who become severely ill experience neurological complications such as delirium, and there is evidence that cognitive difficulties, including confusion and memory loss, [persist for some time after the acute symptoms have cleared](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02599-5)."
"But it is not clear whether this is because the virus can infect the brain, or whether the symptoms are a secondary consequence — perhaps of inflammation."
""
""
""
"## Chronic fatigue"
""
"One of the most insidious long-term effects of COVID-19 is its least understood: severe fatigue."
"Over the past nine months, an increasing number of people have reported crippling exhaustion and malaise after having the virus."
"Support groups on sites such as Facebook host thousands of members, who sometimes call themselves “long-haulers”."
"They struggle to get out of bed, or to work for more than a few minutes or hours at a time."
"One study [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR7) of 143 people with COVID-19 discharged from a hospital in Rome found that 53% had reported fatigue and 43% had shortness of breath an average of 2 months after their symptoms started."
"A study of patients in China showed that 25% had abnormal lung function after 3 months, and that 16% were still fatigued [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR8)."
""
""
"Paul Garner, a infectious-disease researcher at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK, has experienced this at first hand."
"His initial symptoms were mild, but he has since experienced “a roller coaster of ill health, extreme emotions and utter exhaustion”."
"His mind became “foggy” and new symptoms cropped up almost every day, ranging from breathlessness to arthritis in his hands."
""
""
""
"These symptoms resemble chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)."
"The medical profession has struggled for decades to define the disease — leading to a [breakdown of trust with some patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-08965-0)."
"There are no known biomarkers, so it can only be diagnosed based on symptoms."
"Because the cause is not fully understood, it is unclear how to develop a treatment."
"Dismissive attitudes from doctors persist, according to some patients."
""
""
""
"People reporting chronic fatigue after having COVID-19 describe similar difficulties."
"In the forums, many long-haulers say they have received little or no support from doctors — perhaps because many of them showed only mild symptoms, or none at all, and were never hospitalized or in danger of dying."
"It will not be easy to establish the links between COVID-19 and fatigue with certainty, says Randolph."
"Fatigue does not seem to be limited to severe cases."
"It is common in people who had mild symptoms and who therefore might not have been tested for the virus."
""
""
""
"The only way to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 is behind these symptoms is to compare people known to have had the virus with those who have not, says Chertow, to see how often fatigue manifests and in what form."
"Otherwise there is a risk of lumping together people whose fatigue has manifested for different reasons, and who might need distinct treatments."
""
""
""
"Chertow says he is not aware of such a study for COVID-19, but they have been done for other diseases."
"Following the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014–16, US researchers collaborated with the Ministry of Health in Liberia to perform a long-term follow-up study [9](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR9) called Prevail III."
"The study identified six long-term impacts from Ebola, ranging from joint pain to memory loss."
"Bhadelia, who treated hundreds of people with Ebola during the outbreak, says that these post-viral symptoms had not previously been recognized."
"Usually, she says, “we don’t stick around past the acute stage."
"We don’t look at the long tail of recovery."
"It’s important to do that, because it tells you more about the virus and its pathophysiology.”"
""
""
""
"The situation is clearer for people who have been severely ill with COVID-19, especially those who ended up on ventilators, says Chertow."
"In the worst cases, patients experience injury to muscles or the nerves that supply them, and often face “a really long-fought battle on the order of months or up to years” to regain their previous health and fitness, he says."
"He and his colleagues are now recruiting people with COVID-19 from across the severity spectrum for a long-term follow-up study, assessing their brains, lungs, hearts, kidneys and inflammation responses while they are acutely ill, then during recovery a few weeks later, and again after 6–12 months (see [go.nature.com/3mfqqxc](https://go.nature.com/3mfqqxc) )."
""
""
"Once again, there is evidence from SARS that coronavirus infection can cause long-term fatigue."
"In 2011, Harvey Moldofsky and John Patcai at the University of Toronto in Canada described 22 people with SARS, all of whom remained unable to work 13–36 months after infection [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR10)."
"Compared with matched controls, they had persistent fatigue, muscle pain, depression and disrupted sleep."
"Another study [11](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR11), published in 2009, tracked people with SARS for 4 years and found that 40% had chronic fatigue."
"Many were unemployed and had experienced social stigmatization."
""
""
""
"It is not clear how viruses might do this damage, but a 2017 review [12](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR12) of the literature on chronic fatigue syndrome found that many patients have persistent low-level inflammation, possibly triggered by infection."
""
""
""
"If COVID-19 is such a trigger, a wave of psychological effects “may be imminent”, write a group of researchers led by Declan Lyons, a psychiatrist at St Patrick’s Mental Health Services in Dublin [13](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6#ref-CR13)."
"The ME Association, a UK-based charity, says it has received many reports of previously healthy people whose energy levels have not returned to normal after becoming infected with the virus, and expects to see new cases of chronic fatigue syndrome."
"In many countries, the pandemic shows no sign of waning, and health systems are already at capacity responding to acute cases."
"Nevertheless, researchers say it is crucial to start digging into the long-term effects now."
""
""
""
"But the answers will not come quickly."
"“The problem is,” says Gholamrezanezhad, “to assess long-term consequences, the only thing you need is time.”"

"“The bad news is that people show lung impairment from COVID-19 weeks after discharge; the good news is that the impairment tends to ameliorate over time, which suggests the lungs have a mechanism for repairing themselves,” said Dr Sabina Sahanic, who is a clinical PhD student at the University Clinic in Innsbruck and part of the team that carried out the study, which includes Associate Professor Ivan Tancevski, Professor Judith Löffler-Ragg and Dr Thomas Sonnweber in Innsbruck."

"The average age of the 86 patients included in this presentation was 61 and 65% of them were male."
"Nearly half of them were current or former smokers and 65% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients were overweight or obese."
"Eighteen (21%) had been in an intensive care unit (ICU), 16 (19%) had had invasive mechanical ventilation, and the average length of stay in hospital was 13 days."
""
""
""
"A total of 56 patients (65%) showed persistent symptoms at the time of their six-week visit; breathlessness (dyspnoea) was the most common symptom (40 patients, 47%), followed by coughing (13 patients, 15%)."
"By the 12-week visit, breathlessness had improved and was present in 31 patients (39%); however, 13 patients (15%) were still coughing"
""
""
"Tests of lung function included FEV1 (the amount of air that can be expelled forcibly in one second), FVC (the total volume of air expelled forcibly), and DLCO (a test to measure how well oxygen passes from the lungs into the blood)."
"These measurements also improved between the visits at six and 12 weeks."
"At six weeks, 20 patients (23%) showed FEV1 as less than 80% of normal, improving to 18 patients (21%) at 12 weeks, 24 patients (28%) showed FVC as less than 80% of normal, improving to 16 patients (19%) at 12 weeks, and 28 patients (33%) showed DLCO as less than 80% of normal, improving to 19 patients (22%) at 12 weeks."
""
""
""
"The CT scans showed that the score that defines the severity of overall lung damage decreased from eight points at six weeks to four points at twelve weeks."
"Damage from inflammation and fluid in the lungs caused by the coronavirus, which shows up on CT scans as white patches known as ‘ground glass’, also improved; it was present in 74 patients (88%) at six weeks and 48 patients (56%) at 12 weeks."
""
""
""
"At the six-week visit, the echocardiograms showed that 48 patients (58.5%) had dysfunction of the left ventricle of the heart at the point when it is relaxing and dilating (diastole)."
"Biological indicators of heart damage, blood clots and inflammation were all significantly elevated."
""
""
""
"Dr Sahanic said: “We do not believe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is specific to COVID-19, but more a sign of severity of the disease in general."
"Fortunately, in the Innsbruck cohort, we did not observe any severe coronavirus-associated heart dysfunction in the post-acute phase."
"The diastolic dysfunction that we observed also tended to improve with time.”"
""
""
"She concluded: “The findings from this study show the importance of implementing structured follow-up care for patients with severe COVID-19 infection."
"Importantly, CT unveiled lung damage in this patient group that was not identified by lung function tests."
"Knowing how patients have been affected long-term by the coronavirus might enable symptoms and lung damage to be treated much earlier and might have a significant impact on further medical recommendations and advice.”"

"In a [second poster presentation to the Congress](https://k4.ersnet.org/prod/v2/Front/Program/Session?e=259&amp;session=12283), Ms Yara Al Chikhanie, a PhD student at the Dieulefit Santé clinic for pulmonary rehabilitation and the Hp2 Lab at the Grenoble Alps University, France, said that the sooner COVID-19 patients started a pulmonary rehabilitation programme after coming off ventilators, the better and faster their recovery."
""
""
""
"Patients with severe COVID-19 can spend weeks in intensive care on ventilators."
"The lack of physical movement, on top of the severe infection and inflammation, leads to severe muscle loss."
"The muscles for breathing are also affected, which weakens the breathing capacity."
"Pulmonary rehabilitation, which involves physical exercises and advice on managing symptoms, including shortness of breath and post-traumatic stress disorder, is crucial for helping patients to recover fully."
""
""
""
"Ms Al Chikhanie used a walking test to evaluate the weekly progress of 19 patients who had spent an average of three weeks in intensive care and two weeks in a pulmonary ward before being transferred to the Dieulefit Santé clinic for pulmonary rehabilitation."
"Most were still unable to walk when they arrived, and they spent an average of three weeks in rehabilitation."
"The walking test measured how far the patients could walk in six minutes."
"At the beginning, they were able to walk an average of 16% of the distance that, in theory, they should be able to walk normally if healthy."
"After three weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation, this increased to an average of 43%, which was a significant gain but still a serious impairment."
""
""
""
"Ms Al Chikhanie said: “The most important finding was that patients who were admitted to pulmonary rehabilitation shortly after leaving intensive care, progressed faster than those who spent a longer period in the pulmonary ward where they remained inactive."
"The sooner rehabilitation started and the longer it lasted, the faster and better was the improvement in patients’ walking and breathing capacities and muscle gain."
"Patients who started rehabilitation in the week after coming off their ventilators progressed faster than those who were admitted after two weeks."
"But how soon they can start rehabilitation depends on the patients being judged medically stable by their doctors."
"Despite the significant improvement, the average period of three weeks in rehabilitation wasn’t enough for them to recover completely."
""
""
"“These findings suggest that doctors should start rehabilitation as soon as possible, that patients should try to spend as little time as possible being inactive and that they should enrol with motivation in the pulmonary rehabilitation programme."
"If their doctors judge it to be safe, patients should start physical therapy exercises while still in the hospital’s pulmonary ward.”"
""
""
"Thierry Troosters, who was not involved in the study, is President of the European Respiratory Society and Professor in Rehabilitation Sciences at KU Leuven, Belgium."
"He said: “Anecdotal evidence has been emerging since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that many patients suffer debilitating long-term after-effects from the coronavirus."
"Dr Sahanic’s presentation is important because it is one of the first, comprehensive prospective follow-ups of these patients and shows the serious, long-term impact of COVID-19 on the lungs and heart."
"It is sobering to hear that more than half of the patients in this study showed damage to their lungs and hearts 12 weeks after hospital discharge, and that nearly 40% were still suffering from symptoms such as breathlessness."
"The good news, however, is that patients do improve and this surely will help the rehabilitation process, as discussed in the second presentation."
""
""
"“Ms Al Chikhanie’s research complements this information and shows how essential it is for patients to start pulmonary rehabilitation as soon as they are physically able to do so."
"This is why rehabilitation can also be started in the ward, if programmes are adapted to the capabilities of the patient."
"This is perfectly in line with a recent statement of our Society where we also advocate for tailored rehabilitation."
"It is clear from both these studies that rehabilitation, including physical and psychologic components, should be available for patients as soon as possible and it should continue for weeks if not months after they have been discharged from hospital in order to give patients the best chances of a good recovery."
"Governments, national health services and employers should be made aware of these findings and plan accordingly.”"

"# COVID-19:"
"Recovered patients have partially reduced lung function"
""
"More than 86,000 people worldwide have now recovered from the lung disease COVID-19."
"In those cases, the infection manifested itself in mild to moderate form, or it is because these patients received excellent medical care."
""
""
""
"This number can provide solace, on the one hand, but on the other there is still little information about how these people are doing after the infection has run its course."
""
""
""
"With great relief and joy, some convalescents describe how they have survived the physical, but above all psychological stress: the healing of symptoms, the agonizing uncertainty, and the gruelling isolation phase."
"They are happy to be immune to SARS-CoV-2 [after having survived the illness](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-drugs-can-antibodies-from-survivors-help/a-52806428)."
"Relief is often mixed with apprehension — for instance, with regard to the many people who have not yet been infected."
""
""
"**Complete recovery?"
"**"
""
""
"As the new coronavirus generally affects the lower respiratory tract, most of those infected exhibit a [dry cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia.](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-symptoms/a-52233885)"
""
""
"Now researchers in Hong Kong have said that recovered coronavirus patients can be left with damaged lungs."
""
""
""
"A small study of 12 patients discharged from hospital showed that two or three had reduced lung function."
"However, it is too early to confirm any long-term effects."
""
""
""
""In some patients, lung function could decline by about 20 to 30% after recovery," says [Dr. Owen Tsang Tak-yin,](https://www.virology-education.com/owen-tak-yin-tsang-md/)  medical director of the Infectious Diseases Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong."
""
""
""
"Computer tomography have shown fluid- or debris-filled sacs in the lungs, which may get progressively worse as the illness develops."
""
""
""
"The findings from Hong Kong confirm very early investigations from Wuhan in early February 2020."
"In a  [recent study,](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044)  scientists from Zhongnam Hospital of Wuhan University analyzed 140 lung scans of COVID-19 patients and found a ground glass opacity in both lungs of each patient."
""
""
""
"**Suspected pulmonary fibrosis**"
""
"Further investigations of the recovered COVID-19 patients must now be conducted to show whether they have developed [pulmonary fibrosis](https://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/life-with-pf/about-pf)  — scarring in the lungs."
"Over time, the scar tissue can destroy the normal lung and make it hard for oxygen to get into the blood."
"Low oxygen levels (and the stiff scar tissue itself) can cause shortness of breath, particularly during physical exertion."
""
""
""
"Lung fibrosis cannot be cured because the scarred changes in the lung tissue do not regress."
"But the progression of pulmonary fibrosis can be delayed and sometimes even stopped if detected in time."
""
""
""
"Early detected, a pulmonary fibrosis can be stopped"
""
""
"**Are recovered COVID-19 patients immune?"
"**"
""
""
"The majority of virologists are convinced that recovered COVID-19 patients are immune to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus after the infection has run its course."
"After all, the body's own immune system has produced precisely those antibodies during the infection that render the pathogen harmless."
""
""
""
"This all-clear also applies to those who had only a weak course of the disease and showed ofew to no symptoms."
"Nevertheless, their immune systems reacted to the pathogen and produced the corresponding antibodies."
"A renewed infection with the new coronavirus is therefore highly unlikely."
""
""
"* Current research says the coronavirus family of viruses can survive on some surfaces, like door handles, for an average of four to five days."
"Like all droplet infections, SARS-CoV-2 can spread via hands and frequently touched surfaces."
"Although it hasn't previously been seen in humans and therefore hasn't been studied in detail, experts believe it spreads similarly to other known coronaviruses."
""
""
""
"* A certain degree of caution is called for when eating lunch at your work cafeteria or in a cafe — that is, if they haven't been closed yet."
"Technically, coronaviruses can contaminate cutlery or crockery if they're coughed on by an infected person."
"But the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) states that "no infections with SARS-CoV-2 via this transmission route are known to date.""
""
""
"* Should parents fear a possible infection from imported toys?"
"It's unlikely, say the BfR. As of yet, there are no cases of an infection via imported toys or other goods."
"Initial laboratory tests show that the pathogens can remain infectious for up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel - especially in high humidity and cold settings."
""
""
"*"
"A recent study from the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in the US found the novel coronavirus can survive up to 72 hours on stainless steel and up to 24 hours on cardboard surfaces — in an ideal laboratory setting."
"But because the survival of the virus is dependent on many factors like temperature and humidity, the BfR says getting infected from handling the post is "rather unlikely.""
""
""
"* Experts consider the risk of pets being infected with the coronavirus to be very low."
"But they can't yet rule it out."
"The animals themselves show no symptoms, so they don't become ill."
"However, if they are infected, it is possible they could transmit coronaviruses via the air or via excretions (their poop)."
""
""
"* "Unlikely.""
"According to the BfR, transmitting SARS-CoV-2 via contaminated food is not likely to happen and, so far, there are no proven cases of infection this way."
"As the viruses are heat-sensitive, heating food during cooking can further reduce the risk of infection."
"Of course, you should thoroughly wash your hands before cooking and eating — and this goes for anytime, regardless of corona!"
""
""
""
"* Although the SARS and MERS coronaviruses known to date don't like heat, they are quite immune to the cold."
"Research shows they can remain infectious at minus 20 degrees Celsius for up to two years."
"But the BfR gives frozen food the all-clear."
"So far, there's no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection via the consumption of any food, including frozen food."
""
""
""
"* The COVID-19 outbreak has prompted many extraordinary measures and China's ban of the consumption of wild animals is no exception."
"There is compelling research to suggest the novel coronavirus originated in bats before being passed to humans via another intermediate animal."
"But it's not the animals we need to blame — experts say humans are exposed to these viruses via our interaction with animals."

"# Frequent neurologic manifestations and encephalopathy‐associated morbidity in Covid‐19 patients"
"Covid‐19 can involve multiple organs including the nervous system."
"We sought to characterize the neurologic manifestations, their risk factors, and associated outcomes in hospitalized patients with Covid‐19."
""
""
""
"We examined neurologic manifestations in 509 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed Covid‐19 within a hospital network in Chicago, Illinois."
"We compared the severity of Covid‐19 and outcomes in patients with and without neurologic manifestations."
"We also identified independent predictors of any neurologic manifestations, encephalopathy, and functional outcome using binary logistic regression."
""
""
""
"Neurologic manifestations were present at Covid‐19 onset in 215 (42.2%), at hospitalization in 319 (62.7%), and at any time during the disease course in 419 patients (82.3%)."
"The most frequent neurologic manifestations were myalgias (44.8%), headaches (37.7%), encephalopathy (31.8%), dizziness (29.7%), dysgeusia (15.9%), and anosmia (11.4%)."
"Strokes, movement disorders, motor and sensory deficits, ataxia, and seizures were uncommon (0.2 to 1.4% of patients each)."
"Severe respiratory disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 134 patients (26.3%)."
"Independent risk factors for developing any neurologic manifestation were severe Covid‐19 (OR 4.02; 95% CI 2.04–8.89; *P*  < 0.001) and younger age (OR 0.982; 95% CI 0.968–0.996; *P*  = 0.014)."
"Of all patients, 362 (71.1%) had a favorable functional outcome at discharge (modified Rankin Scale 0–2)."
"However, encephalopathy was independently associated with worse functional outcome (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.11–0.42; *P*  < 0.001) and higher mortality within 30 days of hospitalization (35 [21.7%] vs. 11 [3.2%] patients; *P*  < 0.001)."
""
""
""
"Neurologic manifestations occur in most hospitalized Covid‐19 patients."
"Encephalopathy was associated with increased morbidity and mortality, independent of respiratory disease severity."

"However, Covid‐19 is unique in its ability to cause a multi‐organ disease, with involvement of the central and peripheral nervous system in some individuals."
""
""
""
"Indeed, a wide range of neurologic manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection have been recognized, and evidence of their severity and persistence is increasing.[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0003) - [10](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0010)"
"However, the frequency of those manifestations and associated risk factors remain unclear."
"We sought to characterize the incidence of neurologic manifestations, in patients with confirmed Covid‐19 and identify factors associated with the development of neurologic manifestations in hospitalized patients with both severe and non‐severe respiratory disease."
"Furthermore, neurologic manifestations, especially encephalopathy, have been associated with worse clinical outcomes in other systemic illnesses including sepsis and may even lead to significant disability.[11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0011), [12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0012)"
"Therefore, we sought to identify if encephalopathy was associated with greater morbidity in hospitalized patients with Covid‐19."

"NMHC consists of one academic medical center (AMC) and nine other hospitals in the Chicago area."
"Covid‐19 diagnosis was confirmed by SARS‐CoV‐2 reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swab or broncho‐alveolar lavage fluid."
"All laboratory and radiologic assessments were performed as part of routine clinical care."
"This study was approved by our institutional review board (STU00212627) with waiver of consent for retrospective analysis."

""
"Demographic, medical comorbidity, pre‐hospitalization medication usage, and hospital course data were collected by electronic medical record review."
"Laboratory data were collected by automated electronic query."
"Neurologic manifestations were identified by review of clinical notes, diagnostic studies, and physician‐documented diagnoses."
"The identification of neurologic manifestations, the dates of neurologic manifestation onset, and Covid‐19 symptom onset dates was facilitated by electronic note templates implemented in the NMHC System as part of the Covid‐19 response."
"In particular, encephalopathy was identified by (a) report of altered mental status or depressed level of consciousness, (b) physician documented diagnosis of encephalopathy or the delirium encephalopathy syndrome, or (c) positive Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) evaluation."
"The Confusion Assessment Method is a well‐validated and widely used clinical and research tool for the identification of the delirium encephalopathy syndrome and has been in routine clinical use at NMHC since 2008.[13](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0013) -"

"Neurologic manifestations were included starting on the date of Covid‐19 onset, as identified by the patient’s clinical provider, through 90 days."
"In cases where neurologic manifestations were not specifically attributed to a documented diagnosis, the cases were independently adjudicated by two separate neurologists (AB and EML)."
"A third neurologist independently reviewed the chart to serve as a tie‐breaker (IJK) in cases of disagreement."
"In those cases where neurologic manifestations were attributed to a specific neurologic diagnosis (e.g., stroke), the patient was recorded as having that specific diagnosis rather than each component neurologic manifestation."
"Patients were dichotomized into severe versus non‐severe Covid‐19 respiratory disease based on the need for mechanical ventilation during hospitalization; this criterion was used to account for the possibility of delayed clinical deterioration after hospital admission."
""
""
""
"Functional outcome at hospital discharge was extracted from therapy and rehabilitation medicine physician documentation using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) categorized as: mRS 0–2, able to look after ones’ own affairs without assistance; mRS 3, ambulates unassisted but needs help with ones’ own affairs; mRS 4–5, unable to ambulate unassisted and needs assistance for bodily care; and mRS 6, death."
"The discharge mRS scores were determined independently by two reviewers and disagreements were reconciled by majority decision after review (EML)."
""
""
""
"Data were summarized as number of patients (frequency), mean (standard deviation) for normally distributed variables, and median (interquartile range [IQR]) for non‐normally distributed variables."
"Associations were assessed using Fisher’s exact test, Spearman’s rank correlation test, and Wilcoxon rank‐sum test."
"Binary logistic regression models were developed to identify adjusted predictors of: (1) experiencing any neurologic manifestations, (2) experiencing encephalopathy, and (3) having a favorable discharge functional outcome (mRS 0–2)."
"In each case, we first developed a model using *a priori* variables based on biologic plausibility and review of the recent Covid‐19 literature."
"Then we developed models using the *a priori* variables plus additional variables univariately associated with the model outcome at *P*  ≤ 0.15 and not highly collinear with a variable already included."
"To avoid overfitting models to the data, we used a backward variable selection algorithm based on Akaike Information Criteria optimization to develop final *parsimoniously adjusted* models."
"Details of the *a priori* and *parsimonious* models, including the *a priori* variables for each model, are included in the Table [S2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#support-information-section)."
"We also developed an *a priori* binary logistic regression model for the association between encephalopathy and 30‐day mortality adjusted for age, severe Covid‐19 disease, and hospitalization at the AMC; limited numbers of patient deaths prevented inclusion of additional variables for adjustment."
"Two‐sided *P*  ≤ 0.05 was considered significant and all analyses were performed in R version 3.5.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."

"There were 509 consecutive patients included in the study (age 58.5 ± 16.9 years, 281 (55.2%) males), and 134 (26.3%) had severe Covid‐19 requiring mechanical ventilation."
"Neurologic manifestations were present at Covid‐19 onset in 215 patients (42.2%), at hospital admission in 319 patients (62.7%) and at any time during the disease course in 419 patients (82.3%)."
"The most frequent neurologic manifestations were myalgias (228, 44.8%), headaches (192, 37.7%), encephalopathy (162, 31.8%), dizziness (151, 29.7%), dysgeusia (81, 15.9%), and anosmia (58, 11.4%)."

"Differences in frequencies may be caused by genetic factors including polymorphism in expression of the viral receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) in the nervous system, and possibly, SARS‐CoV‐2 strain variations.[18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0018)"
"In addition, our hospital network system was never stressed beyond capacity due to surge preparation and most patients had moderate disease, with only one quarter developing severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation.[19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0019)"
"This may have allowed for more detailed evaluation and identification of neurologic manifestations."
""
""
""
"The fact that any neurologic manifestations as a whole were more likely to occur in younger people is surprising, and could potentially be explained by greater clinical emphasis on the risk of respiratory failure than other symptoms in older patients."
"Alternatively, early neurologic manifestations such as myalgia, headache, or dizziness may have prompted earlier medical care."
"In contrast, encephalopathy was more frequent in older patients."
"Risk factors for encephalopathy also included severe Covid‐19 disease and history of any neurological disorder or chronic kidney disease."
"This is consistent with recent literature identifying higher rates of mortality in Covid‐19 patients with pre‐existing chronic neurological disorders.[20](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0020)"
""
""
"The increased morbidity and mortality associated with encephalopathy, independent of respiratory severity, parallels previous literature in sepsis‐associated encephalopathy and delirium‐associated mortality [11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0011), [21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0021) and emphasizes its relevance in Covid‐19."
"We also found that encephalopathy in Covid‐19 was associated with triple the hospital length of stay."
"Broad recognition and screening for encephalopathy as a contributor to disease severity in Covid‐19 may have utility in resource allocation and potential to improve patient outcomes."
"Furthermore, our findings emphasize the broader need to develop interventions that target encephalopathy as a component of multi‐organ system medical illness."
""
""
""
"The cause of encephalopathy could not be determined with certainty given the lack of extensive diagnostic neurologic testing for most patients in this study due to ongoing pandemic restrictions."
"However, the most likely etiology of encephalopathy in patients with Covid‐19 is multifactorial, including systemic disease and inflammation, coagulopathy, direct neuroinvasion by the virus, endotheliitis and possibly post‐infectious auto‐immune"
"mechanisms.[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0005)"
"Additionally, traditional risk factors associated with intensive care unit delirium and encephalopathy also need to be taken into account, including sedation and analgesia doses, disruption of sleep/wake cycles, and infectious complications.[22](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0022), [23](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0023)"
"Critical illness encephalopathy, in general, can result from multiple mechanisms or combinations of mechanisms that remain an unresolved area of basic science research.[24](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0024)"
""
""
"Our hospital network system includes an AMC and nine other hospitals."
"There was no meaningful difference in severity of disease between the AMC and the other hospitals, but patients at the AMC had better functional outcomes and lower 30‐day mortality."
"One potential explanation for this finding may be related to specialty care, access to resources, and lower rates of do not resuscitate/intubate and comfort measures‐only orders."
"Our AMC is also the largest hospital within the NMHC system with the greatest number of ICU beds, which may confer a survival benefit to critically ill patients with Covid‐19.[25](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0025)"
"A similar difference has been observed in patients with sepsis, who had better outcomes and lower mortality when treated by tertiary versus non‐tertiary hospitals.[26](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0026)"
"Early adoption and implementation of uniform treatment protocols across hospital networks driven by AMCs may be a means to improve outcome and lower mortality of Covid‐19 patients that deserves further investigations."
""
""
""
"Our study has limitations, including its retrospective nature, and the fact that fewer than 6% of patients were evaluated by neurologists or neurosurgeons."
"Since most patients were admitted to dedicated Covid‐19 wards or ICUs with strict infection control precautions in place, access to brain CT or MRI was not as readily available as for other patients with neurologic diseases."
"This limited a more complete neurologic work up in many Covid‐19 patients."
"Additionally, patients were cared for at 10 different hospitals and there may have been varying rates of local geographic infection severity."
"However, this provided us with a more generalized view of the neurologic manifestations in Covid‐19 patients and could identify opportunities for regionalized resource allocation and preparedness protocols in a large hospital network system."
""
""
""
"Only 9 months into the pandemic, the long‐term effects of Covid‐19 on the nervous system remain uncertain."
"Our results suggest that, of all neurologic manifestations, encephalopathy is associated with a worse functional outcome in hospitalized patients with Covid‐19, and may have lasting effects.[12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0012)"
"Long‐term follow‐up is necessary to assess the true burden of encephalopathy in these patients."
"Whether milder forms occur in non‐hospitalized individuals with Covid‐19 who complain of protracted inability to concentrate or decreased short term memory (referred to as ‘brain fog’) warrants further evaluation.[27](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0027)"
"Prospective cognitive and neurologic‐focused evaluations through specialized clinics dedicated to further diagnostic assessment and tailored rehabilitation needs could play a significant role in recovery from this pandemic."

"Researchers in the COVID-19 ‘hot spot’ in the Tyrolean region of Austria recruited consecutive coronavirus patients to their study, who were hospitalised at the University Clinic of Internal Medicine in Innsbruck, the St Vinzenz Hospital in Zams or the cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation centre in Münster, Austria."
"In their presentation to the virtual congress today (Monday), they reported on the first 86 patients enrolled between 29 April and 9 June, although now they have over 150 patients participating."
""
""
""
"The patients were scheduled to return for evaluation six, 12 and 24 weeks after their discharge from hospital."
"During these visits, clinical examinations, laboratory tests, analysis of the amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide in arterial blood, lung function tests, computed tomography (CT) scans and echocardiograms were carried out."
""
""
""
"At the time of their first visit, more than half of the patients had at least one persistent symptom, predominantly breathlessness and coughing, and CT scans still showed lung damage in 88% of patients."
"However, by the time of their next visit 12 weeks after discharge, the symptoms had improved and lung damage was reduced to 56%."
"At this stage, it is too early to have results from the evaluations at 24 weeks."
""
""
"“The bad news is that people show lung impairment from COVID-19 weeks after discharge; the good news is that the impairment tends to ameliorate over time, which suggests the lungs have a mechanism for repairing themselves,” said Dr Sabina Sahanic, who is a clinical PhD student at the University Clinic in Innsbruck and part of the team that carried out the study, which includes Associate Professor Ivan Tancevski, Professor Judith Löffler-Ragg and Dr Thomas Sonnweber in Innsbruck."
""
""
""
"The average age of the 86 patients included in this presentation was 61 and 65% of them were male."
"Nearly half of them were current or former smokers and 65% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients were overweight or obese."
"Eighteen (21%) had been in an intensive care unit (ICU), 16 (19%) had had invasive mechanical ventilation, and the average length of stay in hospital was 13 days."
""
""
""
"A total of 56 patients (65%) showed persistent symptoms at the time of their six-week visit; breathlessness (dyspnoea) was the most common symptom (40 patients, 47%), followed by coughing (13 patients, 15%)."
"By the 12-week visit, breathlessness had improved and was present in 31 patients (39%); however, 13 patients (15%) were still coughing"
""
""
"Tests of lung function included FEV1 (the amount of air that can be expelled forcibly in one second), FVC (the total volume of air expelled forcibly), and DLCO (a test to measure how well oxygen passes from the lungs into the blood)."
"These measurements also improved between the visits at six and 12 weeks."
"At six weeks, 20 patients (23%) showed FEV1 as less than 80% of normal, improving to 18 patients (21%) at 12 weeks, 24 patients (28%) showed FVC as less than 80% of normal, improving to 16 patients (19%) at 12 weeks, and 28 patients (33%) showed DLCO as less than 80% of normal, improving to 19 patients (22%) at 12 weeks."
""
""
""
"The CT scans showed that the score that defines the severity of overall lung damage decreased from eight points at six weeks to four points at twelve weeks."
"Damage from inflammation and fluid in the lungs caused by the coronavirus, which shows up on CT scans as white patches known as ‘ground glass’, also improved; it was present in 74 patients (88%) at six weeks and 48 patients (56%) at 12 weeks."
""
""
""
"At the six-week visit, the echocardiograms showed that 48 patients (58.5%) had dysfunction of the left ventricle of the heart at the point when it is relaxing and dilating (diastole)."
"Biological indicators of heart damage, blood clots and inflammation were all significantly elevated."
""
""
""
"Dr Sahanic said: “We do not believe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is specific to COVID-19, but more a sign of severity of the disease in general."
"Fortunately, in the Innsbruck cohort, we did not observe any severe coronavirus-associated heart dysfunction in the post-acute phase."
"The diastolic dysfunction that we observed also tended to improve with time.”"
""
""
"She concluded: “The findings from this study show the importance of implementing structured follow-up care for patients with severe COVID-19 infection."
"Importantly, CT unveiled lung damage in this patient group that was not identified by lung function tests."
"Knowing how patients have been affected long-term by the coronavirus might enable symptoms and lung damage to be treated much earlier and might have a significant impact on further medical recommendations and advice.”"
""
""
""
"In a [second poster presentation to the Congress](https://k4.ersnet.org/prod/v2/Front/Program/Session?e=259&amp;session=12283), Ms Yara Al Chikhanie, a PhD student at the Dieulefit Santé clinic for pulmonary rehabilitation and the Hp2 Lab at the Grenoble Alps University, France, said that the sooner COVID-19 patients started a pulmonary rehabilitation programme after coming off ventilators, the better and faster their recovery."
""
""
""
"Patients with severe COVID-19 can spend weeks in intensive care on ventilators."
"The lack of physical movement, on top of the severe infection and inflammation, leads to severe muscle loss."
"The muscles for breathing are also affected, which weakens the breathing capacity."
"Pulmonary rehabilitation, which involves physical exercises and advice on managing symptoms, including shortness of breath and post-traumatic stress disorder, is crucial for helping patients to recover fully."
""
""
""
"Ms Al Chikhanie used a walking test to evaluate the weekly progress of 19 patients who had spent an average of three weeks in intensive care and two weeks in a pulmonary ward before being transferred to the Dieulefit Santé clinic for pulmonary rehabilitation."
"Most were still unable to walk when they arrived, and they spent an average of three weeks in rehabilitation."
"The walking test measured how far the patients could walk in six minutes."
"At the beginning, they were able to walk an average of 16% of the distance that, in theory, they should be able to walk normally if healthy."
"After three weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation, this increased to an average of 43%, which was a significant gain but still a serious impairment."
""
""
""
"Ms Al Chikhanie said: “The most important finding was that patients who were admitted to pulmonary rehabilitation shortly after leaving intensive care, progressed faster than those who spent a longer period in the pulmonary ward where they remained inactive."
"The sooner rehabilitation started and the longer it lasted, the faster and better was the improvement in patients’ walking and breathing capacities and muscle gain."
"Patients who started rehabilitation in the week after coming off their ventilators progressed faster than those who were admitted after two weeks."
"But how soon they can start rehabilitation depends on the patients being judged medically stable by their doctors."
"Despite the significant improvement, the average period of three weeks in rehabilitation wasn’t enough for them to recover completely."
""
""
"“These findings suggest that doctors should start rehabilitation as soon as possible, that patients should try to spend as little time as possible being inactive and that they should enrol with motivation in the pulmonary rehabilitation programme."
"If their doctors judge it to be safe, patients should start physical therapy exercises while still in the hospital’s pulmonary ward.”"
""
""
"Thierry Troosters, who was not involved in the study, is President of the European Respiratory Society and Professor in Rehabilitation Sciences at KU Leuven, Belgium."
"He said: “Anecdotal evidence has been emerging since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that many patients suffer debilitating long-term after-effects from the coronavirus."
"Dr Sahanic’s presentation is important because it is one of the first, comprehensive prospective follow-ups of these patients and shows the serious, long-term impact of COVID-19 on the lungs and heart."
"It is sobering to hear that more than half of the patients in this study showed damage to their lungs and hearts 12 weeks after hospital discharge, and that nearly 40% were still suffering from symptoms such as breathlessness."
"The good news, however, is that patients do improve and this surely will help the rehabilitation process, as discussed in the second presentation."
""
""
"“Ms Al Chikhanie’s research complements this information and shows how essential it is for patients to start pulmonary rehabilitation as soon as they are physically able to do so."
"This is why rehabilitation can also be started in the ward, if programmes are adapted to the capabilities of the patient."
"This is perfectly in line with a recent statement of our Society where we also advocate for tailored rehabilitation."
"It is clear from both these studies that rehabilitation, including physical and psychologic components, should be available for patients as soon as possible and it should continue for weeks if not months after they have been discharged from hospital in order to give patients the best chances of a good recovery."
"Governments, national health services and employers should be made aware of these findings and plan accordingly.”"
""
""
"More than 86,000 people worldwide have now recovered from the lung disease COVID-19."
"In those cases, the infection manifested itself in mild to moderate form, or it is because these patients received excellent medical care."
""
""
""
"This number can provide solace, on the one hand, but on the other there is still little information about how these people are doing after the infection has run its course."
""
""
""
"With great relief and joy, some convalescents describe how they have survived the physical, but above all psychological stress: the healing of symptoms, the agonizing uncertainty, and the gruelling isolation phase."
"They are happy to be immune to SARS-CoV-2 [after having survived the illness](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-drugs-can-antibodies-from-survivors-help/a-52806428)."
"Relief is often mixed with apprehension — for instance, with regard to the many people who have not yet been infected."

"Now researchers in Hong Kong have said that recovered coronavirus patients can be left with damaged lungs."
""
""
""
"A small study of 12 patients discharged from hospital showed that two or three had reduced lung function."
"However, it is too early to confirm any long-term effects."
""
""
""
""In some patients, lung function could decline by about 20 to 30% after recovery," says [Dr. Owen Tsang Tak-yin,](https://www.virology-education.com/owen-tak-yin-tsang-md/)  medical director of the Infectious Diseases Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong."
""
""
""
"Computer tomography have shown fluid- or debris-filled sacs in the lungs, which may get progressively worse as the illness develops."
""
""
""
"The findings from Hong Kong confirm very early investigations from Wuhan in early February 2020."
"In a  [recent study,](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044)  scientists from Zhongnam Hospital of Wuhan University analyzed 140 lung scans of COVID-19 patients and found a ground glass opacity in both lungs of each patient."
""
""
""
"**Suspected pulmonary fibrosis**"
""
"Further investigations of the recovered COVID-19 patients must now be conducted to show whether they have developed [pulmonary fibrosis](https://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/life-with-pf/about-pf)  — scarring in the lungs."
"Over time, the scar tissue can destroy the normal lung and make it hard for oxygen to get into the blood."
"Low oxygen levels (and the stiff scar tissue itself) can cause shortness of breath, particularly during physical exertion."
""
""
""
"Lung fibrosis cannot be cured because the scarred changes in the lung tissue do not regress."
"But the progression of pulmonary fibrosis can be delayed and sometimes even stopped if detected in time."
""
""
""
"Early detected, a pulmonary fibrosis can be stopped"
""
""
"**Are recovered COVID-19 patients immune?"
"**"
""
""
"The majority of virologists are convinced that recovered COVID-19 patients are immune to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus after the infection has run its course."
"After all, the body's own immune system has produced precisely those antibodies during the infection that render the pathogen harmless."
""
""
""
"This all-clear also applies to those who had only a weak course of the disease and showed ofew to no symptoms."
"Nevertheless, their immune systems reacted to the pathogen and produced the corresponding antibodies."
"A renewed infection with the new coronavirus is therefore highly unlikely."
""
""
"* Current research says the coronavirus family of viruses can survive on some surfaces, like door handles, for an average of four to five days."
"Like all droplet infections, SARS-CoV-2 can spread via hands and frequently touched surfaces."
"Although it hasn't previously been seen in humans and therefore hasn't been studied in detail, experts believe it spreads similarly to other known coronaviruses."
""
""
""
"* A certain degree of caution is called for when eating lunch at your work cafeteria or in a cafe — that is, if they haven't been closed yet."
"Technically, coronaviruses can contaminate cutlery or crockery if they're coughed on by an infected person."
"But the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) states that "no infections with SARS-CoV-2 via this transmission route are known to date.""
""
""
"* Should parents fear a possible infection from imported toys?"
"It's unlikely, say the BfR. As of yet, there are no cases of an infection via imported toys or other goods."
"Initial laboratory tests show that the pathogens can remain infectious for up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel - especially in high humidity and cold settings."
""
""
"*"
"A recent study from the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in the US found the novel coronavirus can survive up to 72 hours on stainless steel and up to 24 hours on cardboard surfaces — in an ideal laboratory setting."
"But because the survival of the virus is dependent on many factors like temperature and humidity, the BfR says getting infected from handling the post is "rather unlikely.""
""
""
"* Experts consider the risk of pets being infected with the coronavirus to be very low."
"But they can't yet rule it out."
"The animals themselves show no symptoms, so they don't become ill."
"However, if they are infected, it is possible they could transmit coronaviruses via the air or via excretions (their poop)."
""
""
"* "Unlikely.""
"According to the BfR, transmitting SARS-CoV-2 via contaminated food is not likely to happen and, so far, there are no proven cases of infection this way."
"As the viruses are heat-sensitive, heating food during cooking can further reduce the risk of infection."
"Of course, you should thoroughly wash your hands before cooking and eating — and this goes for anytime, regardless of corona!"
""
""
""
"* Although the SARS and MERS coronaviruses known to date don't like heat, they are quite immune to the cold."
"Research shows they can remain infectious at minus 20 degrees Celsius for up to two years."
"But the BfR gives frozen food the all-clear."
"So far, there's no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection via the consumption of any food, including frozen food."
""
""
""
"* The COVID-19 outbreak has prompted many extraordinary measures and China's ban of the consumption of wild animals is no exception."
"There is compelling research to suggest the novel coronavirus originated in bats before being passed to humans via another intermediate animal."
"But it's not the animals we need to blame — experts say humans are exposed to these viruses via our interaction with animals."
