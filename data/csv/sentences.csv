"An engineer had to plan the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy."
"To feed the lake he thought to build a unique wide canal collecting water coming from a near valley."
"However, a mason pointed out that during the flood periods the stream of water flowing along the canal might be too strong and might damage the surrounding areas; by contrast, during the drought periods a unique stream of water might be insufficient to feed the lake."
"In order to avoid these mishaps, the mason suggested to build, instead of a unique wide canal, four small canals whose total flow was the same as the unique wide canal previously planned."
"These small canals were placed around the lake so that they conveyed water coming from four different valleys."
"In this way only small amounts of water could flow in each canal and thus during flood periods dangerous overflowing might not occur."
"At the same time, the lake was fed by water from various belts, so that also during drought periods it was sufficiency that the fed."
"Many of the faculty in the English department got their degrees in the 1960s."
"This era has clearly left its mark on the faculty."
"They are vocal proponents of environmental causes, and they often encourage their students to speak out on these issues."
"Because of their wellknown stance as activists, many members of the faculty have been called to testify before Congress."
"As a result, many members of this department have become recognizable faces on television news programs."
"The English department faculty also have excellent reputations as teachers."
"Not only are the faculty in this department extremely bright, they are able to enter the �beginner�s mind� and present material in a clear engaging manner."
"Because of this teaching skill, the English faculty have developed a rather smug attitude, and often look down on members of other departments."
"As a result, the members of the English department are resented by many faculty from other departments."
"A doctor is faced with a patient who has a malignant tumour in his stomach."
"It is impossible to operate on the patient, but unless the tumour is destroyed the patient will die."
"X-rays can be used to destroy the tumour."
"If an X-ray reaches it at sufficiently high intensity the tumour will be destroyed."
"Unfortunately, at this intensity the healthy tissue that the ray passes through on the way to the tumour will also be destroyed."
"At lower intensities the ray is harmless to healthy tissue, but it will not affect the tumour either."
"It looked like the patient was going to die."
"The faculty in the Political Science department have strenuously and successfully pursued research grants to allow them to conduct their research."
"As a result, this department has more money for the pursuit of research than any other department at the University."
"This funding has allowed the faculty to hire research assistants for all of the faculty members."
"Because every faculty member has a research assistant, the faculty have had enough time to maintain high-level research careers without sacrificing the quality of their teaching."
"The Political Science department at Fallsburg is one of the largest departments at the University."
"The undergraduate students have consistently rated the faculty in this department as the best teachers on campus."
"Their reputation as fine teachers has spread throughout the campus so that almost every student wants to take at least one Political Science course during their studies."
"This popularity has caused most of the Political Science courses to be oversubscribed."
"Students must often wait over a year to get into the course of their choice."
"The Political Science department has an odd mix of faculty."
"About half of the professors have a strong interest in the role of Socialist and Marxist ideology in world government."
"The other half of the faculty study the emergence of democratic republics, particularly in Third World nations."
"Despite these radically different orientations, most of the professors are quite open-minded."
"In fact, the department recently organized a conference at which both groups gave talks about their findings."

"Zerdia Literal Similarity: Once there was an eagle named Zerdia who nested on a rocky cliff."
"One day she saw a sportsman coming with a cross-bow and some bolts that had no feathers."
"The sportsman attacked but the bolts missed."
"Zerdia realized that the sportsman wanted her tail feathers so she flew down and donated a few of her tail feathers to the sportsman."
"The sportsman was pleased."
"He promised never to attack eagles again."
"In a university lab a very expensive lightbulb which would emit precisely controlled quantities of light was being used in some experiments."
"One morning the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive lightbulb came into the lab and found to her dismay that the lightbulb no longer worked."
"She realized that, she had forgotten to turn it off the previous night."
"As a result the lightbulb overheated, and the filament inside the bulb had broken into two parts."
"The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open It."
"The lightbulb could be repaired if a brief, high intensity laser ray could be used to fuse the two parts of the filament into one."
"Furthermore the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job."
"However, a high intensity laser ray would also break the fragile glass surrounding the filament."
"At lower intensity the laser ray would not break the glass, but neither would it fuse the filament."
"So it seemed that the lightbulb could not be repaired."
"How could you solve this situation?"
"An engineer plans the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy."
"According to his first plan, a unique wide canal collects water coming from a valley and convey it into the lake."
"The total labor cost for the construction of such canal is $17,66+"
"However, the engineer realizes that during the drought periods a unique stream of water may be insufficient to feed the lake."
"In order to avoid this mishap, the engineer elaborates a second plan."
"According to this plan, the lake is fed by four canals."
"These canals are placed around the lake so that they convey water coming from four different belts."
"In this way the lake is fed by water from various valleys, so that also during drought periods it is sufficiently fed."
"To implement the second plan 12 laborers have to work 8 hours daily for 23 days."
"Each laborer is paid $8 for each hour of work."
"The total labor of the second plan is cheaper, equal or more expansive than the labor of the first plan?"
"Cord Problem Suppose you are in a room, where two cords are hung from the ceiling."
"The two cords are of such a  length that when you hold one cord in either hand, you cannot reach the other."
"Your task is to  tie the ends of these cords together."
"To help you in this task, you may use any of the objects  listed below, which are also in this room: poles, clamps, pliers, extension cords, tables,  chairs."
"A water pumping station in the hills above Peshawar has recently been adapted to feed a nuclear power facility, where the water acts as a coolant."
"Unfortunately the main pipe that leads from the water pumping station to the nuclear facility cannot stand the increased pressure and will eventually rupture."
"The nuclear power facility must have a continuous supply at a certain volume or it will overheat and go into meltdown."
"Experts have found that it is impossible to build a single large pipe to carry the water with the materials available that will not also rupture due to the high pressure of the water flowing through it."
"The suggestion is: to build a number of pipes that have less water pressure."
"The biology department at Fallsburg teaches many of the pre-medical courses for the students, and also prides itself on maintaining an active research program."
"Over the last few years, a number of the older faculty have taken advantage of an early retirement program offered by the state, and, three younger faculty were lured to another school with offers of higher salaries."
"These departures have left the Biology department with fewer faculty than they would like to have."
"Because there are fewer faculty than are needed in this department, it has been difficult for them to carry out all of the administrative work that needs to be done."
"There are not enough faculty to organize meetings for faculty business and to advise majors in biology."
"The undergraduate students have consistently rated the faculty in this department as the best teachers on campus."
"Their reputation as fine teachers has spread throughout the campus so that almost every student wants to take at least one Biology course during their studies."

"Once upon a time there lived a magical genie."
"He was a very old, wise, and rich genie indeed."
"One day while he was polishing his home, which was actually a bottle, he decided he would like to find an even bigger and better home to live in."
"So he began searching far and wide for another bottle."
"Finally he found the perfect home."
"It was larger, prettier, and not too far away from his old bottle."
"The genie was very excited and began moving his belongings right away."
"But now the genie had a problem."
"He had a great many beautiful and very precious jewels in his old home."
"He had to somehow get all the jewels from his old bottle to the new bottle without dropping or losing a single jewel."
"After thinking a bit, the genie came up with a wonderful idea."
"He searched for his magic carpet."
"Then he commanded it to roll itself up into a long hollow tube."
"Next the genie commanded his flying carpet to place one end at his old home and the other end at his new home so that it formed a sort of hollow bridge between the two bottles."
"Then, the genie very carefully took one jewel from inside his old home and placed it into the opening of his carpet."
"At once, the jewel began tumbling and rolling through the carpet tube until it reached his new home and plopped safely inside."
"The genie grinned happily and began rolling all his jewels through the carpet into his new home."
"In fact, I'm sure you can still find him sitting in his new, bigger and better bottle with all his jewels and smiling contentedly even today!"
"Broken Light-bulb problem insufficient-intensity - Laser"
"In a physics lab at a major university, a very expensive light bulb which would emit"
"precisely controlled quantities of light was being used in some experiments."
"Ruth was the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive light bulb."
"One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the light bulb no longer worked."
"She realized that she had forgotten to tum it off the previous night."
"As a result the light bulb overheated, and the filament inside the bulb had broken into two parts."
"The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it."
"Ruth knew that the light bulb could be repaired if a brief, high-intensity laser beam could be used to fuse the two parts of the filament into one."
"Furthermore, the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job."
"However, the lasers only generated low-intensity beams that were not strong enough to fuse the filament."
"She needed a much more intense laser beam."
"So it seemed that the light bulb could not be repaired, and a costly replacement would be required."
"Ruth was about to give up when she had an idea."
"She placed several lasers in a circle around the light bulb, and administered low-intensity laser beams from several directions all at once."
"The beams all converged on the filament, where their combined effect was enough to fuse it."
"Ruth was greatly relieved that the light bulb was repaired, and she then went on to successfully complete the experiment."
"The computer science department at Gordmont is widely acknowledged to be one of the finest groups of its kind in the world."
"Over the last five years, the department has been ranked number one among computer science departments in terms of the number of publications by the faculty."
"This success has allowed the members of the faculty to secure a number of large contracts that provide funds for the professors to carry out their research."
"Unfortunately, the research reputation of this department is only outdone by the personal reputations of the individual faculty."
"Almost all of the professors are known to be difficult to get along with."
"Indeed, the individual members of the department seem to have little or no respect for each other."
"Two bowls are on a table, one within the child's reach and one farther away."
"One bowl contains a number of small gumballs, and the other is empty."
"Also on the table is an aluminum walking cane, a large rectangular sheet of heavy paper (posterboard), a hollow cardboard tube long enough to reach the farther bowl, child-safe scissors, string, tape, paper clips, and rubber bands."
"The task is to use the materials provided, to transferr the balls from the filled bowl to the empty bowl without leaving their seat."
"Red Adair"
"An oil well in Saudi Arabia exploded and caught fire."
"The result was a blazing inferno that consumed an enormous quantity of oil each day."
"After initial efforts to extinguish it failed, famed firefighter Red Adair was called in."
"Red knew that the fire could be put out if a huge amount of fire retardant foam could be dumped on the base of the well."
"There was enough foam available at the site to do the job."
"However, there was no hose large enough to put all the foam on the fire fast enough."
"The small hoses that were available could not shoot the foam quickly enough to do any good."
"It looked like there would have to be a costly delay before a serious attempt could be made."
"However, Red Adair knew just what to do."
"He stationed men in a circle all around the fire, with all of the available small hoses."
"When everyone was ready all of the hoses were opened up and foam was directed at the fire from all directions."
"In this way a huge amount of foam quickly struck the source of the fire."
"The blaze was extinguished, and the Saudis were satisfied that Red had earned his three million dollar fee."
"Once upon a time there lived a magical genie."
"He was a very old, wise, and rich genie indeed."
"One day while he was polishing his home, which was actually a bottle, an old friend came up."
"The genie told his friend, "I'm going to look for a bigger and better home to live in."
"Will you help me look?"
"" So they began searching far and wide for another bottle."
"Finally the genie found the perfect home."
"It was larger, prettier, and not too far away from his old bottle."
"The genie was very excited and wanted to begin moving his be- longings right away."
"But now the genie had a prob- lem."
"He had a great many beautiful and very precious jewels in his old home."
"He had to somehow get all the jewels from his old bottle to the new bottle without dropping or losing a single jewel."
"After thinking a bit, the genie came up with a wonderful idea."
"He began searching for his magic staff, or wand."
"He then commanded his staff to stretch itself from his old home to his new home."
"Next, the genie tugged and pulled on his magical staff until at last he pulled the new bottle right up next to his old bottle."
"At once, the genie began gathering his jewels together in his old home and simply dropped them carefully into his new home right next to him."
"When all his jewels were safely tucked away in his new home, the genie settled in happily."
"He invited his friend to come in and admire his new home."
"His friend came in and said, "What a good house for you!""
"I'm sure you can still find the genie sitting in his new bigger and better bottle with all his jewels and smiling contentedly even today!"
"Fused Light-bulb fragile-glass - Ultrasound"
"In a physics lab at a major university, a very expensive light bulb which would emit"
"precisely controlled quantities of light was being used in some experiments."
"Ruth was the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive light bulb."
"One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the light bulb no longer worked."
"She realized that she had forgotten to tum it off the previous night."
"As a result the light bulb overheated, and two wires in the filament inside the bulb fused together."
"The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it."
"Ruth knew that the light bulb could be repaired if a brief, high-intensity ultrasound wave could be used to jar apart the fused parts."
"Furthermore, the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job."
"However, a high-intensity ultrasound wave would also break the fragile glass surrounding the filament."
"At lower intensities the ultrasound wave would not break the glass, but neither would it jar apart the fused parts."
"So it seemed that the light bulb could not be repaired, and a costly replacement would be required."
"Ruth was about to give up when she had an idea."
"She placed several ultrasound machines in a circle around the light bulb, and administered low-intensity ultrasound waves from several directions all at once."
"The waves all converged on the filament, where their combined effect was enough to jar apart the fused parts."
"Since each spot on the surrounding glass received only a low-intensity wave from one ultrasound machine, the glass was left intact."
"Ruth was greatly relieved that the light bulb was repaired, and she then went on to successfully complete the experiment."
"The Videogame Sales Case Vortex, Inc., a small video-arcade software firm, had a promising new line of special forces videogames."
"Keppel and Co., a major manufacturer of video-arcade equipment in Europe, was working with Vortex to produce the hardware needed for the special forces games."
"They were negotiating over how to share revenues from their joint product."
"The deal was mostly going smoothly"
"�Vortex wanted to broaden the market for its products and Keppel needed a boost in sales to meet their shareholders expectations for the year."
"However, the two companies were struggling with how to split sales revenues."
"Keppel was demanding a high percentage from sales to finance the added expense of a custom-made action control for Vortex�s games."
"Further, Keppel knew that it had the greatest resources to get Vortex�s special forces games on the market."
"On the other hand, Vortex was also demanding a high percentage from sales on the grounds that what was being sold was their games, they had the patent on the new action control, and Keppel was simply one of several available manufacturers."
"Having negotiations at a standstill was bad for both companies because Keppel needed to increase their sales by the end of the year and Vortex needed to get their products out while they were still state of the art."
"The breakthrough came when negotiators from Keppel and Vortex began discussing the differing needs of their companies."
"The negotiation teams reached the following agreement: Vortex would give up some of its share of revenue for the remainder of the year to cover Keppel�s production costs and to aid their current financial situation."
"In return, Keppel would give up a comparable share of revenue in future fiscal years for these products, and Vortex still maintained their patent on the new control device."
"Carl wasn't working at the time."
"He was very concerned because he had very little left in his bank account."
"Several days later he had lunch with the president about becoming a broker."
"Carl thought he had impressed people when he gave his resume to the investment firm."
"Carl went to the department store and tried on some suits, and got a few."
"He felt that he was moving up again."

"What type of procedure might be used to destroy the tumor with the x-rays and at the same time avoid destroying the healthy tissue?"
"The General A small country was ruled from a strong fortress by a dictator."
"The fortress was situated in the middle of the country, surrounded by farms and villages."
"Many roads led to the fortress through the countryside."
"A rebel general vowed to capture the fortress."
"The general knew that an attack by his entire army would capture the fortress."
"He gathered his army at the head of one of the roads, ready to launch a full-scale direct attack."
"However, the general then learned that the dictator had planted mines on each of the roads."
"The mines were set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely, since the dictator needed to move his troops and workers to and from the fortress."
"However, any large force would detonate the mines."
"Not only would this blow up the road, but it would also destroy many neighboring villages."
"It therefore seemed impossible to capture the fortress."
"However, the general devised a simple plan."
"He divided his army into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different road."
"When all was ready he gave the signal and each group marched down a different road."
"Each group continued down its road to the fortress so that the entire army arrived together at the fortress at the same time."
"In this way, the general captured the fortress and overthrew the dictator."
"The Identical Twins"
"Once there were identical twins who were continually playing pranks on their family, friends, and teachers."
"The annual school picnic was always a big event for the twins."
"There were races and other athletic events in which the twins won lots of prizes."
"One year a new student arrived who was a star runner."
"The twins wanted to win the main event: the 2-mile race through the woods behind the school."
"So they secretly devised a plan which would enable them to outdo the newcomer."
"The day of the race arrived."
"Each runner was to pick his own path through the woods to a clearing, where a teacher stood posted to determine the winner."
"One twin entered the race, while the other excused himself on the grounds that he had hurt his leg in an earlier broad jumping event."
"The race began and the students rushed into the woods."
"The twin rushed into the woods and waited until the others had passed out of sight."
"Then he went back to the school using a path hidden from the picnic area."
"Shortly after, the other twin, who had been hiding behind a rock near the finish line of the race, burst out and ran into the clearing ahead of the other runners."
"The teacher named him the winner and marveled at the speed of his running."
"Next year the twins switched places and thereafter maintained their status on this event."
"The Asian Merchant Case Syd, a recently promoted head buyer of a small retail clothing chain in the United States, had bought some wholesale leather boots from a large Asian manufacturer."
"All aspects of the deal had been successfully negotiated except the shipment of the boots."
"Although Syd thought there might be potential difficulties in dealing with a large multinational conglomerate, she had decided to purchase boots from this company�rather than from several smaller available manufacturers�because of their aggressive pricing."
"The sales representative from the Asian company told Syd that they would pay to ship the boots by boat."
"Syd was concerned because the United States has announced that a trade embargo would likely be placed on all goods from that country in the near future."
"The Asian sales representative told Syd not to worry because the boat would arrive at the U.S. dock before the embargo occurred."
"Syd, however, thought that the boat would be late and that the multinational conglomerate�s policy to ship goods was not friendly to the needs of small businesses."
"Syd wanted the merchant to pay to ship the boots by air freight (which was substantially more expensive)."
"The Asian sales representative refused because of the higher cost."
"They argued about when the boat would arrive."
"Syd considered breaking off the deal and buying the boots from her next best option, a small manufacturer."
"However, she did not like their product line as well and also wanted to try to establish a relationship with the large multinational conglomerate."
"Finally, after a lengthy discussion in which it seemed that the negotiations might break off unsuccessfully, Syd suggested a new proposal to the sales representative from the Asian manufacturer."
"They would send the boots by air freight but both sides would watch when the boat actually docks in the United States."
"If the boat happened to arrive on time (as the sales representative believed it would), Syd would pay for the added cost of air freight."
"However, if the boat were to arrive late (as Syd believed it would), the Asian manufacturer would pay the air freight bill."
"Syd and the Asian manufacturer were pleased with this proposal, and each party got the arrangement they wanted."
"Ernie was really encouraged about his interview for a security guard at the new factory in town."
"He thought he was saved."
"Ernie went to the shopping mall and hunted around for a dark blue security guard uniform, and bought several."
"The next day he received a phone call from the factory personnel director about the security guard position."
"Ernie  was dismayed  that  "
"he  had  wasted  money.  "
"He didn't  have a job."
"Tumor: Suppose you are a doctor faced with a patient who has a malignant tumor in his stomach."
"It is impossible to operate on the patient, but unless the tumor is destroyed the patient will die."
"There is a kind of ray that can be used to destroy the tumor."
"If the rays reach the tumor all at once at a sufficiently high intensity, the tumor will be destroyed."
"Unfortunately, at this intensity the healthy tissue that the rays pass through on the way to the tumor will also be destroyed."
"At lower intensities the rays are harmless to healthy tissue, but they will not affect the tumor either."
"What type of procedure might be used to destroy the tumor with the rays, and at the same time avoid destroying the healthy tissue?"
"Unfortunately, many of the faculty in the Biology department at Fallsburg have strong personalities and big egos."
"Inevitably, this has led to personality clashes among the faculty."
"It is not uncommon for faculty meetings in this department to erupt into shouting matches."
"One result of these arguments is that the faculty rarely go to their University offices, except during office hours to avoid running into their colleagues."
"Because the faculty are rarely in their offices, undergraduates and graduate students alike complain that the faculty are inaccessible."
"One of the most striking aspects of the Biology department is the tremendous financial support for research."
"One result of this has been a high level of motivation for faculty members to excel at their research."
"Faculty members in this department often spend long hours on their research."
"This hard work has paid off, as the department is among the top 10 of all Biology departments in its research reputation nationally."
"Having just been fired from a high level job, he decided to go to his church for counseling.  "
"The  pastor  calmed  the businessman."
"The Commander: A military government was established after the elected government was toppled in a coup."
"The military imposed martial law and abolished all civil liberties."
"A tank corp commander and his forces remained loyal to the overthrown civilian government."
"They hid in a forest waiting for a chance to launch a counterattack."
"The commander felt he could succeed if only the military headquarters could be captured."
"The headquarters was located on a heavily guarded island situated in the center of a lake."
"The only way to reach the island was by way of several pontoon bridges that connected it to the surrounding area."
"However, each bridge was so narrow and unstable that only a few tanks could cross at once."
"Such a small force would easily be repulsed by the defending troops."
"The headquarters therefore appeared invincible."
"However, the tank commander tried an unexpected tactic."
"He secretly sent a number of tanks to locations near each bridge leading to the island."
"Then under cover of darkness the attack was launched simultaneously across each bridge."
"All of the groups of tanks arrived on the island together and immediately converged on the military headquarters."
"They managed to capture the headquarters and eventually restore the civilian government."

"The Political Science department has an odd mix of faculty."
"About half of the professors have a strong interest in the role of Socialist and Marxist ideology in world government."
"The other half of the faculty study the emergence of democratic republics, particularly in Third World nations."
"Despite these radically different orientations, most of the professors are quite open-minded."
"In fact, the department recently organized a conference at which both groups gave talks about their findings."
"The conference was quite well received, and a favorable story about the meeting appeared in The Washington Post."
"The faculty in Political Science are quite active researchers, and almost all of them have research grants from large government agencies."
"These grants provide the department with money to hire personnel."

"The English department at Fallsburg is one of the largest departments at the University."
"The undergraduate students have consistently rated the faculty in this department as the best teachers on campus."
"Their reputation as fine teachers has spread throughout the campus so that almost every student wants to take at least one English course during their studies."
"This popularity has caused most of the English courses to be oversubscribed."
"Students must often wait over a year to get into the course of their choice."
"Unfortunately, many of the faculty in the English department have strong personalities and big egos."
"Inevitably, this has led to personality clashes among the faculty."
"It is not uncommon for faculty meetings in this department to erupt into shouting matches."
"One result of these arguments is that the faculty rarely go to their University offices, except during office hours to avoid running into their colleagues."
"Fortress-2 Supply Route:"
"A small country fell under the iron rule of a dictator."
"The dictator ruled the country from a strong fortress."
"The fortress was situated in the middle of the country, surrounded by farms and villages."
"Many roads radiated outward from the fortress like spokes on a wheel."
"A great general arose who raised a large army at the border and vowed to capture the fortress and free the country of the dictator."
"The general knew that if his entire army could attack the fortress at once it could be captured."
"His troops were poised at the head of one of the roads leading to the fortress, ready to attack."
"However, a spy brought the general a disturbing report."
"The ruthless dictator had planted mines on each of the roads."
"The mines were set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely, since the dictator needed to be able to move troops and workers to and from the fortress."
"However, any large force would detonate the mines."
"Not only would this blow up the road and render it impassable, but the dictator would then destroy many villages in retaliation."
"The general, however, was undaunted."
"He knew that one major thoroughfare leading to the fortress was always kept open as a supply route."
"He led his army to the head of the supply route."
"When all was ready he gave the signal, and the entire army charged down the open route."
"The army avoided the mines and attacked the fortress in full strength."
"In this way, the general was able to capture the fortress and overthrow the dictator."

"The Birthday Party"
"It was Jane�s sixth birthday and her mother wanted to make it a very special day for her."
"So she  organized a big surprise party and invited the neighborhood children without Jane knowing about  it."
"The plan was that the mother who usually picked up Jane after school would be late in order  to allow the children time to arrive before Jane."
"The big day finally arrived."
"Everything was  just about ready, and it was fifteen minutes before the children were supposed to come."
"Jane�s  mother was putting the final touches on the decorations for the party room."
"She was covering the  walls and ceiling with balloons and party streamers made of crepe paper and ribbons."
"Jane�s  mother was finishing up a decoration pattern."
"Two final pieces were left that were dangling from  the wood paneling above."
"She had originally planned to knot these two pieces of ribbon together  in order to attach balloons to them."
"However, whenever she grabbed the end of one ribbon, colored  blue, she was not able to grasp the other ribbon, colored pink, at the same time."
"The ribbons  simply were not long enough to be knotted together in this way."
"It seemed that she would have to abandon her final bit of decoration."
"Jane's mother was just about to give up when she had an idea."
"She took the pair of scissors that  she had been using to cut the various ribbons and crepe paper, and attached the scissors to the  end of the ribbon."
"Next, she took hold of the scissors, and pointing them in the direction of the  pink ribbon, swung them vigorously so that this blue ribbon now swayed alternately between the  pink ribbon and a nearby wall."
"She then ran quickly and took the end of the dangling pink ribbon  and walked as close to the swinging blue ribbon as possible without letting go of the pink  ribbon."
"She then waited until the swinging blue ribbon came her way and caught it on the upswing.  "
"While still holding the pink ribbon, she then removed the scissors from the other blue ribbon and  knotted the two ribbons together."
"Jane�s mother just managed to attach all her balloons on these  ribbons, completing her decorations, before the children started pouring in."
"Soon Jane arrived  and was genuinely surprised."
"The party was a great success, and all the mothers complemented Jane�s mother on the decorations."
"An engineer plans the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy."
"According to his first plan, a single wide canal collects water coming from a valley and conveys it into the lake."
"However, the engineer realizes that during the flood periods the stream of water flowing along the canal may be too strong and may damage the surrounding areas."
"He also realizes that during the drought periods a single stream of water may be insufficient to feed the lake."
"In order to avoid these mishaps, the engineer elaborates a second plan."
"According to this plan, the lake is fed by four small canals whose total flow is the same as the single wide canal previously planned."
"These small canals are placed around the lake so that they convey water coming from four different valleys."
"In this way only small amounts of water can flow in each canal and thus during flood periods dangerous overflowings might not occur."
"At the same time, the lake is fed by water from various valleys, so that also during drought periods it is sufficiently fed."
"Sam travelled all over the world buying beautiful things."
"When he ran out of money he paid a visit to his mother."
"However, she was not at all pleased with him."
"While I have been hard at work you have been wasting your time, she said."
"Sam gave her a gift he bought in Tibet, hoping she would give him a loan in return."
"But she was still not pleased."
"I will not give you any of my hard-earned money!" she exclaimed."
"One unusually warm spell in February Sam the magpie thought ''"
"This is my chance.""
"He stood up on the edge of his nest and trilled proudly."
"His song was so loud and cheerful that it woke a nearby chipmunk."
"The chipmunk asked for another song."
"He was so moved by Sam's talents that he forgot"
"it was still winter and decided to go looking for nuts to store."
"An engineer plans the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy."
"According to his first plan, a unique wide canal collects water coming from a valley and convey it into the lake."
"The total labor cost for the construction of such canal is $17,664."
"However, the engineer realizes that the capacity of the lake is not sufficient to produce the needed amount of energy."
"However, it is`not possible to enlarge the lake because there are no free areas around it."
"In order to avoid this mishap, the engineer elaborates a second plan."
"According to this plan, the lake must be deepened so that it contains a higher amount of water."
"To implement the second plan 12 laborers have to work 8 hours daily for 23 days."
"Each laborer is paid $8 for each hour of work."
"The total labor of the second plan is cheaper, equal or more expansive than the labor of the first plan?"
"Miss Piggy's most precious possessions were her jewels."
"She kept them in a jewel box on top of her dresser."
"She decided they weren't very safe there, so she wanted to move them to a strong safe on the other side of the room."
"Miss Piggy started to carry a few of her jewels across the room to the safe."
"But just then Gonzo went running through the room, with Fozzy Bear chasing him."
"They almost knocked Miss Piggy down."
"She was afraid they would come back at any moment and make her drop some jewels and lose them."
"She had so many jewels"
"-how could she get them all over to the safe quickly and safely?"
"Suddenly Miss Piggy had a great idea."
"She rolled up her carpet off the floor and picked it up."
"The carpet just reached from her jewel box to the safe."
"Then Miss Piggy quickly rolled her jewels through the rolled carpet and into the safe."
"She was finished in a jiffy, before Fozzy Bear and Gonzo came back."
"The jewels were safe, and Miss Piggy was very happy."
"The degree of animosity between members of the faculty in Anthropology is obvious to anyone who looks at the department."
"This has not gone unnoticed at other Universities, where it has been viewed as a potential opportunity, and at least once per semester, a faculty member in the department is offered another job at a prestigious University."
"The offers from outside schools has led a number of faculty members to leave in recent years."
"Because of their work with people with people from other cultures, the Anthropology faculty tend to be politically active."
"In particular, the faculty in this department are on the boards of many charities."
"In their classes, they organize fund-raising drives for multi-cultural causes."
"This activity has fostered a spirit of giving at the University, and has led to a strong community involvement among students."
"In a university lab a very expensive lightbulb which would emit precisely controlled quantities of light was being used in some experiments."
"One morning the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive lightbulb came into the lab and found to her dismay that the lightbulb no longer worked."
"She realized that, she had forgotten to turn it off the previous night."
"As a result the lightbulb overheated, and the filament inside the bulb had broken into two parts."
"The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open It."
"The lightbulb could be repaired if a brief, high intensity laser ray could be used to fuse the two parts of the filament into one."
"Furthermore the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job."
"However, a high intensity laser ray would also break the fragile glass surrounding the filament."
"At lower intensity the laser ray would not break the glass, but neither would it fuse the filament."
"So it seemed that the lightbulb could not be repaired."
"How could you solve this situation?"
"The Annual Meeting Case The Sales and Marketing divisions of a large health maintenance corporation were trying to decide where to hold their annual meeting."
"There were substantial disagreements between the two divisions that were beginning to create conflict between them."
"The Sales division wanted to go to a lodge in the mountains."
"They had researched this possibility already and were anxious to reserve a location as soon as possible."
"The Marketing division, on the other hand, wanted to go a major city."
"They had already generated materials on the potential exposure of their company in several urban markets in preparation."
"The two divisions considered the compromise of holding two annual meetings, but both the added cost and the hectic travel schedules of the executives involved made this option unfeasible."
"There was added pressure from company leaders to hold a single annual meeting given the potential benefits of building better working relationships across divisions which had a history of tense and competitive relations."
"Indeed, one objective of the annual meeting was to foster better relations between the two divisions."
"One member of the Sales division was appointed to negotiate with one member of the Marketing division concerning the location of the annual meeting."
"As the division planners gained trust in each other, important understandings emerged."
"The Sales division desired to run the annual meeting as a retreat to talk about important company issues, which required having a location suitable to focusing on the work at hand."
"The Marketing division saw the annual meeting as an opportunity to promote the company image."
"The two divisions resolved to create a well-publicized annual meeting located in the mountains, and they agreed to maintain open lines of communication between divisions."
"The Two Poor Brothers Case Two fairly poor brothers, Ben and Jerry, had just inherited a working farm whose main crop has a volatile price."
"Ben wanted to sell rights to the farm�s output under a long-term contract for a fixed amount rather than depend upon shares of an uncertain revenue stream."
"In short, Ben was risk averse."
"Jerry, on the other hand, was confident that the next season would be spectacular and revenues would be high."
"In short, Jerry was risk seeking."
"The two argued for days and nights."
"Ben wanted to sell immediately because he believed the price of the crop would fall; Jerry wanted to keep the farm because he believed the price of the crop would increase."
"Jerry could not afford to buy Ben out at the time, but the strain on their family relationship over their disagreements was becoming too large."
"Ben had always trusted Jerry�s instincts in the past, but this time felt Jerry was being overly optimistic."
"In an effort to settle the matter and close up the growing rift between them, the two brothers agreed to meet with a family business advisor."
"Following the consultation, Jerry proposed a possible agreement to his brother: They would keep the farm for another season."
"If the price of the crop fell below a certain price (as Ben thought it would), then they would sell the farm and Ben would get 50% of the farm�s current value, adjusted for inflation; Jerry would get the rest."
"However, if the price of the crop were to rise (as Jerry thought it would), Jerry would buy Ben out for 50% of the farm�s current value, adjusted for inflation, and would get to keep all of the additional profits for himself."
"Jerry was delighted when his brother told him he could agree to this arrangement, thereby avoiding further conflict."
"Karla the Hawk: Karla, an old hawk, lived at the top of a tall oak tree."
"One afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers."
"The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but missed."
"Karla knew the hunter wanted her feathers so she glided down to the hunter and offered to give him a few."
"The hunter was so grateful that he pledged never to shoot at a hawk again."
"He went off and shot a deer instead."
