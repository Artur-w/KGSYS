"An engineer plans the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy."
"According to his first plan, a unique wide canal collects water coming from a valley and convey it into the lake."
"The total labor cost for the construction of such canal is $17,66+"
"However, the engineer realizes that during the drought periods a unique stream of water may be insufficient to feed the lake."
"In order to avoid this mishap, the engineer elaborates a second plan."
"According to this plan, the lake is fed by four canals."
"These canals are placed around the lake so that they convey water coming from four different belts."
"In this way the lake is fed by water from various valleys, so that also during drought periods it is sufficiently fed."
"To implement the second plan 12 laborers have to work 8 hours daily for 23 days."
"Each laborer is paid $8 for each hour of work."
"The total labor of the second plan is cheaper, equal or more expansive than the labor of the first plan?"

"A water pumping station in the hills above Peshawar has recently been adapted to feed a nuclear power facility, where the water acts as a coolant."
"Unfortunately the main pipe that leads from the water pumping station to the nuclear facility cannot stand the increased pressure and will eventually rupture."
"The nuclear power facility must have a continuous supply at a certain volume or it will overheat and go into meltdown."
"Experts have found that it is impossible to build a single large pipe to carry the water with the materials available that will not also rupture due to the high pressure of the water flowing through it."
"The suggestion is: to build a number of pipes that have less water pressure."

"A doctor is faced with a patient who has a malignant tumor in his stomach."
"It is impossible to operate on the patient, but unless the tumor is destroyed the patient will die."
"X rays can be used to destroy the tumor."
"If a x ray reaches it at a sufficiently high intensity, the tumor will be destroyed."
"Unfortunately at this intensity the healthy tissue that the ray passes through on the way to the tumor will also be destroyed."
"At lower intensities the ray is harmless to healthy tissue but it will not affect the tumor either."
"What type of procedure might be used to destroy the tumor with the x rays and at the same time avoid destroying the healthy tissue?"

"Researchers in the COVID 19 ‘hot spot’ in the Tyrolean region of Austria recruited consecutive coronavirus patients to their study, who were hospitalised at the University Clinic of Internal Medicine in Innsbruck, the St Vinzenz Hospital in Zams or the cardio pulmonary rehabilitation centre in Münster, Austria."
"In their presentation to the virtual congress today (Monday), they reported on the first 86 patients enrolled between 29 April and 9 June, although now they have over 150 patients participating."
"The patients were scheduled to return for evaluation six, 12 and 24 weeks after their discharge from hospital."
"During these visits, clinical examinations, laboratory tests, analysis of the amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide in arterial blood, lung function tests, computed tomography (CT) scans and echocardiograms were carried out."
"At the time of their first visit, more than half of the patients had at least one persistent symptom, predominantly breathlessness and coughing, and CT scans still showed lung damage in 88% of patients."
"However, by the time of their next visit 12 weeks after discharge, the symptoms had improved and lung damage was reduced to 56%."
"At this stage, it is too early to have results from the evaluations at 24 weeks."
"“The bad news is that people show lung impairment from COVID 19 weeks after discharge; the good news is that the impairment tends to ameliorate over time, which suggests the lungs have a mechanism for repairing themselves,” said Dr Sabina Sahanic, who is a clinical PhD student at the University Clinic in Innsbruck and part of the team that carried out the study, which includes Associate Professor Ivan Tancevski, Professor Judith Löffler Ragg and Dr Thomas Sonnweber in Innsbruck."
"The average age of the 86 patients included in this presentation was 61 and 65% of them were male."
"Nearly half of them were current or former smokers and 65% of hospitalised COVID 19 patients were overweight or obese."
"Eighteen (21%) had been in an intensive care unit (ICU), 16 (19%) had had invasive mechanical ventilation, and the average length of stay in hospital was 13 days."
"A total of 56 patients (65%) showed persistent symptoms at the time of their six week visit; breathlessness (dyspnoea) was the most common symptom (40 patients, 47%), followed by coughing (13 patients, 15%)."
"By the 12 week visit, breathlessness had improved and was present in 31 patients (39%); however, 13 patients (15%) were still coughingTests of lung function included FEV1 (the amount of air that can be expelled forcibly in one second), FVC (the total volume of air expelled forcibly), and DLCO (a test to measure how well oxygen passes from the lungs into the blood)."
"These measurements also improved between the visits at six and 12 weeks."
"At six weeks, 20 patients (23%) showed FEV1 as less than 80% of normal, improving to 18 patients (21%) at 12 weeks, 24 patients (28%) showed FVC as less than 80% of normal, improving to 16 patients (19%) at 12 weeks, and 28 patients (33%) showed DLCO as less than 80% of normal, improving to 19 patients (22%) at 12 weeks."
"The CT scans showed that the score that defines the severity of overall lung damage decreased from eight points at six weeks to four points at twelve weeks."
"Damage from inflammation and fluid in the lungs caused by the coronavirus, which shows up on CT scans as white patches known as ‘ground glass’, also improved; it was present in 74 patients (88%) at six weeks and 48 patients (56%) at 12 weeks."
"At the six week visit, the echocardiograms showed that 48 patients (58.5%) had dysfunction of the left ventricle of the heart at the point when it is relaxing and dilating (diastole)."
"Biological indicators of heart damage, blood clots and inflammation were all significantly elevated."
"Dr Sahanic said: “We do not believe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is specific to COVID 19, but more a sign of severity of the disease in general."
"Fortunately, in the Innsbruck cohort, we did not observe any severe coronavirus associated heart dysfunction in the post acute phase."
"The diastolic dysfunction that we observed also tended to improve with time.”"
"She concluded: “The findings from this study show the importance of implementing structured follow up care for patients with severe COVID 19 infection."
"Importantly, CT unveiled lung damage in this patient group that was not identified by lung function tests."
"Knowing how patients have been affected long term by the coronavirus might enable symptoms and lung damage to be treated much earlier and might have a significant impact on further medical recommendations and advice.”"
"In a second poster presentation to the Congress (https://k4.ersnet.org/prod/v2/Front/Program/Session?e=259&amp;session=12283), Ms Yara Al Chikhanie, a PhD student at the Dieulefit Santé clinic for pulmonary rehabilitation and the Hp2 Lab at the Grenoble Alps University, France, said that the sooner COVID 19 patients started a pulmonary rehabilitation programme after coming off ventilators, the better and faster their recovery."
"Patients with severe COVID 19 can spend weeks in intensive care on ventilators."
"The lack of physical movement, on top of the severe infection and inflammation, leads to severe muscle loss."
"The muscles for breathing are also affected, which weakens the breathing capacity."
"Pulmonary rehabilitation, which involves physical exercises and advice on managing symptoms, including shortness of breath and post traumatic stress disorder, is crucial for helping patients to recover fully."
"Ms Al Chikhanie used a walking test to evaluate the weekly progress of 19 patients who had spent an average of three weeks in intensive care and two weeks in a pulmonary ward before being transferred to the Dieulefit Santé clinic for pulmonary rehabilitation."
"Most were still unable to walk when they arrived, and they spent an average of three weeks in rehabilitation."
"The walking test measured how far the patients could walk in six minutes."
"At the beginning, they were able to walk an average of 16% of the distance that, in theory, they should be able to walk normally if healthy."
"After three weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation, this increased to an average of 43%, which was a significant gain but still a serious impairment."
"Ms Al Chikhanie said: “The most important finding was that patients who were admitted to pulmonary rehabilitation shortly after leaving intensive care, progressed faster than those who spent a longer period in the pulmonary ward where they remained inactive."
"The sooner rehabilitation started and the longer it lasted, the faster and better was the improvement in patients’ walking and breathing capacities and muscle gain."
"Patients who started rehabilitation in the week after coming off their ventilators progressed faster than those who were admitted after two weeks."
"But how soon they can start rehabilitation depends on the patients being judged medically stable by their doctors."
"Despite the significant improvement, the average period of three weeks in rehabilitation wasn’t enough for them to recover completely."
"“These findings suggest that doctors should start rehabilitation as soon as possible, that patients should try to spend as little time as possible being inactive and that they should enrol with motivation in the pulmonary rehabilitation programme."
"If their doctors judge it to be safe, patients should start physical therapy exercises while still in the hospital’s pulmonary ward.”"
"Thierry Troosters, who was not involved in the study, is President of the European Respiratory Society and Professor in Rehabilitation Sciences at KU Leuven, Belgium."
"He said: “Anecdotal evidence has been emerging since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic that many patients suffer debilitating long term after effects from the coronavirus."
"Dr Sahanic’s presentation is important because it is one of the first, comprehensive prospective follow ups of these patients and shows the serious, long term impact of COVID 19 on the lungs and heart."
"It is sobering to hear that more than half of the patients in this study showed damage to their lungs and hearts 12 weeks after hospital discharge, and that nearly 40% were still suffering from symptoms such as breathlessness."
"The good news, however, is that patients do improve and this surely will help the rehabilitation process, as discussed in the second presentation."
"“Ms Al Chikhanie’s research complements this information and shows how essential it is for patients to start pulmonary rehabilitation as soon as they are physically able to do so."
"This is why rehabilitation can also be started in the ward, if programmes are adapted to the capabilities of the patient."
"This is perfectly in line with a recent statement of our Society where we also advocate for tailored rehabilitation."
"It is clear from both these studies that rehabilitation, including physical and psychologic components, should be available for patients as soon as possible and it should continue for weeks if not months after they have been discharged from hospital in order to give patients the best chances of a good recovery."
"Governments, national health services and employers should be made aware of these findings and plan accordingly.”"

"An engineer had to plan the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy."
"To feed the lake he thought to build a unique wide canal collecting water coming from a near valley."
"However, a mason pointed out that during the flood periods the stream of water flowing along the canal might be too strong and might damage the surrounding areas; by contrast, during the drought periods a unique stream of water might be insufficient to feed the lake."
"In order to avoid these mishaps, the mason suggested to build, instead of a unique wide canal, four small canals whose total flow was the same as the unique wide canal previously planned."
"These small canals were placed around the lake so that they conveyed water coming from four different valleys."
"In this way only small amounts of water could flow in each canal and thus during flood periods dangerous overflowing might not occur."
"At the same time, the lake was fed by water from various belts, so that also during drought periods it was sufficiency that the fed."

"Around half of COVID 19 patients who received an echocardiogram in hospital showed abnormalities in heart function, according to a prospective international survey funded by the British Heart Foundation and published in the European Heart Journal‒Cardiovascular Imaging (https://academic.oup.com/ehjcimaging/article/doi/10.1093/ehjci/jeaa178/5859292)."
"The study, authored by Marc Dweck (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK), found that around one in seven showed severe abnormalities likely to have a major effect on their survival and recovery."
""
"It also showed that one in three patients who received an echocardiography scan had their treatment changed as a result."
"The findings suggest that heart scans could prove crucial for identifying patients who may benefit from additional treatments to improve their COVID 19 recovery and prevent potential long term damage to their heart, the Foundation said in a press release."
"Marc Dweck, the study’s lead author and British Heart Foundation senior lecturer and consultant cardiologist at the University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, UK), said: “COVID 19 is a complex, multisystem disease which can have profound effects on many parts of the body, including the heart."
"Many doctors have been hesitant to order echocardiograms for patients with COVID 19 because it’s an added procedure which involves close contact with patients."
"Our work shows that these scans are important – they improved the treatment for a third of patients who received them.”"
"Researchers from the British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence at the University of Edinburgh looked at echocardiogram results of 1,216 patients from 69 countries with COVID 19.The scan results were sourced from many Covid 19 hotspots around the world, allowing researchers to urgently understand the impact of Covid 19 on the heart while the pandemic was at its peak."
"In the study, over half (55%) of patients, including those with pre existing heart disease, showed abnormal changes to the way their heart was pumping, with around one in seven showing evidence of severe dysfunction."
"The majority (901) had no known heart disease before the study and showed similar changes."
"Almost half (46%) and one in eight (13%) showed abnormal changes and severe dysfunction respectively."
"These changes were observed for the first time during the patients’ COVID 19 illness and the researchers believe they could be due to the effects of the virus."
"Results showed that left ventricular abnormalities were reported in 479 (39%) patients, with echocardiographic evidence of new myocardial infarction in 36 (3%), myocarditis in 35 (3%), and takotsubo cardiomyopathy in 19 (2%)."
"Left ventricular impairment was classified as mild, moderate, or severe in 17, 12, and 9% of patients, respectively."
"Right ventricular abnormalities were reported in 397 (33%) patients, with mild or moderate right ventricular impairment in 19% and severe impairment in 6%."
"Right ventricular dilatation (15%), elevated pulmonary artery pressures (8%), and a D shaped left ventricle (4%) were reported less frequently."
"Cardiac tamponade and endocarditis were reported in 11 (1%) and 14 (1%) patients, respectively."
"Severe cardiac disease, defined as severe left or right ventricular dysfunction or cardiac tamponade, was reported in 1 in 7 patients (n = 182, 15%)."
"In the study, one third of patients had their treatment changed as a result of the echocardiogram."
"This included being given medicines for heart failure, or more careful control of fluids and therapy designed to support heart function."
"The researchers point out several limitations to the study given its observational design."
"During the pandemic the number of scans being carried out would have been balanced with the risk of exposing staff, patients and equipment to the virus, they note, and patients who received the scans were in hospital and had suspected heart complications, usually because they had abnormal blood markers reflecting heart damage."
"This study does not tell us how common heart changes are in people who did not receive a scan."
