Sam travelled all over the world buying beautiful things. When he ran out of money he paid a visit to his mother. However, she was not at all pleased with him. "While I have been hard at work you have been wasting your time," she said. Sam gave her a gift he bought in Tibet, hoping she would give him a loan in return. But she was still not pleased. "I will not give you any of my hard-earned money!" she exclaimed.
