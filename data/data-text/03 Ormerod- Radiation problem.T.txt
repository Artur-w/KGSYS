A doctor is faced with a patient who has a malignant tumour in his stomach. It is impossible to operate on the patient, but unless the tumour is destroyed the patient will die. X-rays can be used to destroy the tumour. If an X-ray reaches it at sufficiently high intensity the tumour will be destroyed. Unfortunately, at this intensity the healthy tissue that the ray passes through on the way to the tumour will also be destroyed. At lower intensities the ray is harmless to healthy tissue, but it will not affect the tumour either. It looked like the patient was going to die.
