The Wine Merchants One day a rich man found that his wine cellar was empty. So he sent out messengers to announce a generous offer. The first person to bring the rich man a barrel of wine would be given a brick of solid gold. However, the offer would expire at sundown. Two wine merchants heard the news. Each had a horse-drawn cart loaded with large barrels of wine. They both set out for the duke's palace at once. An hour before sundown they came to a place where the bridge had been washed out by a raging river. The first merchant drove his horses and cart into the flood in a desperate attempt to reach the other side. But the horses were already exhausted and could not fight the current. The cart overturned, and the horses, wine, and driver were washed away. The second merchant tried a different tactic. He poured the wine out of all but one of his barrels, and lashed them together to form a raft; then he loaded the one full barrel, a horse, and himself on top. He set the raft adrift and floated downstream. In a few minutes the raft came to rest on the shore in front of the town where the rich man lived. The merchant disembarked, loaded the wine barrel on the horse, and led it to the rich man's house. He arrived just as the sun was setting, and collected the gold brick as a reward for his efforts.
