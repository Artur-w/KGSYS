An engineer plans the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy. According to his first plan, a single wide canal collects water coming from a valley and conveys it into the lake. However, the engineer realizes that during the flood periods the stream of water flowing along the canal may be too strong and may damage the surrounding areas. He also realizes that during the drought periods a single stream of water may be insufficient to feed the lake. In order to avoid these mishaps, the engineer elaborates a second plan. According to this plan, the lake is fed by four small canals whose total flow is the same as the single wide canal previously planned. These small canals are placed around the lake so that they convey water coming from four different valleys. In this way only small amounts of water can flow in each canal and thus during flood periods dangerous overflowings might not occur. At the same time, the lake is fed by water from various valleys, so that also during drought periods it is sufficiently fed.
