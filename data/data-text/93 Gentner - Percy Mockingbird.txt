Percy the mockingbird spent the whole warm season chirping and twittering. When it began to get colder Percy visited a squirrel and sang a song for her, expecting to get some of the squirrel's sunflower seeds in return. However, the squirrel was very disappointed in him. "You are a terrible singer!" she yel1ed. 'Tm not giving you any of my wheat." A tear roUed down Percy's cheek, and he vowed to give up singing for good.
