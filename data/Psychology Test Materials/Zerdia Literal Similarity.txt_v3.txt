Zerdia Literal Similarity: 
Once there was an eagle named Zardia who nested on a rocky cliff. One day she saw a sportsman coming with a cross-bow and some bolts that had no feathers. The sportsman attacked but the bolts missed. Zardia realized that the sportsman wanted her tail feathers so she flew down and donated a few of her tail feathers to the sportsman. The sportsman was pleased. He promised never to attack eagles again.
