Zerdia True Analogy:
Once there was a small country called Zardia that learned to make the worldï¿½s smartest computer. One day Zardia was attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach. But the missiles were badly aimed and the attack failed. The Zardian government realized that Gagrach wanted Zardian computers so it offered to sell some of its computers to the country. The government of Gagrach was very pleased. It promised never to attack Zardia again.
