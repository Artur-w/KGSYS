Zerdia Mere appearance: 
Once there was an eagle named Zardia who donated a few of her tail feathers to a sportsman so he would promise never to attack eagles. One day Zardia was resting high on a rocky cliff when she saw the sportsman coming with a cross-bow. Zardia flew down to meet the man, but he attacked and felled her with a single bolt. As she fluttered to the ground Zardia realized that the bolt had her own tail feathers on it.
