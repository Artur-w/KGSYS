An engineer plans the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy. According to his first plan, a unique wide canal collects water coming from a valley and convey it into the lake. The total labor cost for the construction of such canal is $17,664. However, the engineer realizes that the capacity of the lake is not sufficient to produce the needed amount of energy. However, it is`not possible to enlarge the lake because there are no free areas around it. In order to avoid this mishap, the engineer elaborates a second plan. According to this plan, the lake must be deepened so that it contains a higher amount of water. To implement the second plan 12 laborers have to work 8 hours daily for 23 days. Each laborer is paid $8 for each hour of work. The total labor of the second plan is cheaper, equal or more expansive than the labor of the first plan?
