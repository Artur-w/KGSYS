Miss Piggy's most precious possessions were her jewels. She kept them in a jewel box on top of her dresser. She decided they weren't very safe there, so she wanted to move them to a strong safe on the other side of the room. Miss Piggy started to carry a few of her jewels across the room to the safe. But just then Gonzo went running through the room, with Fozzy Bear chasing him. They almost knocked Miss Piggy down. She was afraid they would come back at any moment and make her drop some jewels and lose them. She had so many jewels-how could she get them all over to the safe quickly and safely? 
Suddenly Miss Piggy had a great idea. She rolled up her carpet off the floor and picked it up. The carpet just reached from her jewel box to the safe. Then Miss Piggy quickly rolled her jewels through the rolled carpet and into the safe. She was finished in a jiffy, before Fozzy Bear and Gonzo came back. The jewels were safe, and Miss Piggy was very happy.
