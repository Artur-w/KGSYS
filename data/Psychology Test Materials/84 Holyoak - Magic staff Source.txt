Once upon a time there lived a magical genie. He was a very old, wise, and rich genie indeed. One day while he was polishing his home, which was actually a bottle, he decided he would like to find an even bigger and better home to live in. So he began searching far and wide for another bottle. Finally he found the perfect home. It was larger, prettier, and not too far away from his old bottle. The genie was very excited and began moving his belongings right away. But now the genie had a problem. He had a great many beautiful and very precious jewels in his old home. He had to somehow get all the jewels from his old bottle to the new bottle without dropping or losing a single jewel. After thinking a bit, the genie came up with a wonderful idea. 
He began searching for his magic staff, or wand. He then commanded his staff to stretch itself from his old home to his new home. Next, the genie tugged and pulled on his magical staff until at last he pulled the new bottle right up next to his old bottle. At once, the genie began gathering his jewels together in his old home and simply dropped them carefully into his new home right next to him. When all his jewels were safely tucked away in his new home, the genie settled in happily. In fact, I'm sure you can still find him sitting in his new, bigger, and better bottle with all his jewels and smiling contentedly even today!
