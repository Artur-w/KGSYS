"He attributed the success to Hong Kong’s “early diagnosis and early treatment” of patients, which leaves the virus with less time to wreak havoc on the body."
"That’s made injections of interferon the “backbone” of early treatments."
"Critical illness encephalopathy, in general, can result from multiple mechanisms or combinations of mechanisms that remain an unresolved area of basic science research.[24](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#acn351210-bib-0024)"
"Cardiologists urge anyone with symptoms like shortness of breath or chest discomfort after COVID-19 to see a doctor, but they worry about a flood of healthy recovered people clamoring for heart assessments."
"Furthermore, our findings emphasize the broader need to develop interventions that target encephalopathy as a component of multi‐organ system medical illness."
"Additionally, half the patients had at least five colds in the previous year — a characteristic no one in the control group shared, said the 2017 paper published online in [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09536-z)."
"People with more severe infections might experience long-term damage not just in their lungs, but in their heart, immune system, brain and elsewhere."
"But it is not clear whether this is because the virus can infect the brain, or whether the symptoms are a secondary consequence — perhaps of inflammation."
"Chronic medications prior to hospitalization and experimental treatments provided during hospitalization are listed in Table [S3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51210#support-information-section)."
"That’s critical because the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus or “viral load” in patients peaks at around the time symptoms appear -- similar to influenza."
"Researchers in the COVID-19 ‘hot spot’ in the Tyrolean region of Austria recruited consecutive coronavirus patients to their study, who were hospitalised at the University Clinic of Internal Medicine in Innsbruck, the St Vinzenz Hospital in Zams or the cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation centre in Münster, Austria."
"Whether SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, induces cardiac injury including myocarditis more often, or with greater severity, than other viruses is still unclear."
"In the worst cases, patients experience injury to muscles or the nerves that supply them, and often face “a really long-fought battle on the order of months or up to years” to regain their previous health and fitness, he says."
"“We need clinical guidelines on what this care of survivors of COVID-19 should look like,” says Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious-diseases clinician at Boston University School of Medicine in Massachusetts, who is setting up a clinic to support people with COVID-19."
"“Ms Al Chikhanie’s research complements this information and shows how essential it is for patients to start pulmonary rehabilitation as soon as they are physically able to do so."
"In more than half of virus-induced cases, the inflammation resolves without incident."
"A recent expert consensus article recommended 2-week convalescence followed by no diagnostic cardiac testing if asymptomatic and an electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiogram in mildly symptomatic athletes with COVID-19 to return to play for competitive sports.5 However, emerging knowledge and CMR observations question this recommendation."
"Additionally, the rate of LGE (42%) is higher than in previously described normative populations."
"And although in some cases the most severe infections also cause the worst long-term impacts, even mild cases can have life-changing effects — notably a lingering malaise similar to chronic fatigue syndrome."
"This study does not tell us how common heart changes are in people who did not receive a scan."
"Tracking and figuring out how Covid-19 affects the body even after recovery could inform governments budgeting for social safety nets, doctors that see patients long term, and businesses as they set policies such as sick and disability leave."
"Therefore, we sought to identify if encephalopathy was associated with greater morbidity in hospitalized patients with Covid‐19."
"The effect was greatest when treatment was started within a week of symptom onset, the authors said, noting “an important time-to-treatment effect on mortality.”"
"Because millions are now contracting the coronavirus, even a small proportion who suffer severe myocarditis would amount to a lot of people."
"“This is so new that I don’t think anyone is able to tell what is the percentage of patients who will recover, what is the percentage of patients who will not recover and have long-term sequela,” said Michelle Biehl, a critical care pulmonary doctor at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, using the medical term for chronic conditions after a disease."
"A renewed infection with the new coronavirus is therefore highly unlikely."
"Because of the physical demands of sports, team doctors need to be on guard for myocarditis."
"One of the most insidious long-term effects of COVID-19 is its least understood: severe fatigue."
"That prediction came true in December, when the first cases of a [mysterious pneumonia](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-03/pneumonia-outbreak-spurs-fever-checks-from-singapore-to-taiwan) came to light in Wuhan, in China’s Hubei province."
"Many doctors have been hesitant to order echocardiograms for patients with COVID-19 because it’s an added procedure which involves close contact with patients."
"The ME Association, a UK-based charity, says it has received many reports of previously healthy people whose energy levels have not returned to normal after becoming infected with the virus, and expects to see new cases of chronic fatigue syndrome."
"The identification of neurologic manifestations, the dates of neurologic manifestation onset, and Covid‐19 symptom onset dates was facilitated by electronic note templates implemented in the NMHC System as part of the Covid‐19 response."
"But such studies are scarce."
"Since most patients were admitted to dedicated Covid‐19 wards or ICUs with strict infection control precautions in place, access to brain CT or MRI was not as readily available as for other patients with neurologic diseases."

"The study, authored by Marc Dweck (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK), found that around one in seven showed severe abnormalities likely to have a major effect on their survival and recovery."
